*A tale about building a new world…*

![The SCREAM module WIP /// Blockchain Native Game /// Immersive Gameplay Experience](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/7f2f643ad92b7bf698cbf492f9abbce01a89854d5e0cfeaf0e7851eb6a1c8602.png)

Attention, Deep Space Explorers!

All citizens of the stars are feeling the cosmic currents of change. From the faction’s homeworlds to the enigmatic Iris, all metaverse children feel jolts of euphoria and excitement as our projects reach a new stage of maturity!

We are back for another Atlas Star ✧, the official Star Atlas newsletter wherein all things start and end, delivering all of the crucial information to our community about Star Atlas, related [project developments](https://www.notion.so/staratlas/72cb710bbd894cd8819bde948e42ac31?v=6146a2da2c0a45b58e0c4fb1c0a2d845), and much more!

For this edition, we’ll focus on the single most desired project within Star Atlas — the one that begins the fable of the ultimate gaming experience that until now has been hidden in the depths of ATMTA Inc.

We are, of course, talking about **SCREAM**, the next major Star Atlas browser-playable gameplay module with a full economic loop.

We will do a deep dive into SCREAM and other exciting projects that will be debuting in the not-so-distant future.

We thank the community for their continued support. Through storms and tempest, you have stayed by our side, and we will ask you for just a little more patience as we prepare to enter this next exciting era.

In this report, you’ll learn about our macro view of SCREAM. In the following editions, we’ll delve deeper into the micro-level of its gameplay.

Please remember that everything being said here is**subject to change.**

Without further ado, let’s talk SCREAM.

## SCREAM Game Design Statement

![Prepare the engines. It’s going to be a long journey. /// Triple-A Metaverse Work in Progress /// Immersive Unreal Engine 5 Experience.](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/aa2e4cb7a6065a02f090c4075d29ff1c6633eafdd8ac39a1deb7469f1fd03fa4.png)

Every journey starts with a question, and in this case, our efforts have been informed by this one: How can we showcase the essence of Star Atlas through SCREAM?

To be fair, we also asked ourselves the following:

1. Is this game actually fun?
1. Can players play this over and over?
1. Are we focusing on ship utility?
1. Is the game logic and game state hosted on-chain?

You can see how constructing our ‘simple’ game is no easy task. Yet, we challenged ourselves to develop a concept that would embrace the key aspects of a true Star Atlas game as laid out in our original [White Paper](https://staratlas.com/assets/pdfs/white-paper.pdf) and [Economics Paper](https://staratlas.com/economics-paper.pdf).

Put another way: SCREAM will be a blockchain-native multiplayer game complete with economic, political, and strategic elements. This will be the first time that players can use their ships to fight for the future of their faction with fun, active, repeatable, on-chain gameplay with earning potential.

Even this definition might be lacking because, as we hope to demonstrate, SCREAM will be an enticing challenge, requiring tough choices, coordination, and strategic thinking from our players on both a faction and regional level.

Without further adieu, let’s take a tour of SCREAM’s context, game loops, and structures.

P.S. We believe this will give enough material for many Atlas Brews!

## Overview — The Context of Scream

![Whispers of war can be heard everywhere in the galaxy /// Triple-A Metaverse Work in Progress /// Immersive Unreal Engine 5 Experience](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/85f71dd1b6407f7e718242266a2246b4b9cb7ff83632a1b0034951081a51c879.png)

For reasons to be disclosed through the lore, a veiled conflict is happening in the universe at the time of SCREAM. Although the Treaty of Peace is officially in force, the three faction’s guilds move their fleet through the galaxy, trying to “integrate’’ different systems into their factions, effectively creating the so-called medium risk zone.

Although the factions say that they are not involved with any warlike activity, incursions of MUD, ONI, and Ustur DACs have been witnessed in nearby systems. Moreover, DACs are building enormous structures called**starbases**, which the populations of said systems perceive to be means of political domination.

This has turned into a conflict with the political powers that ruled these worlds. Factions like the Jorvik and ECOS didn’t take this intrusion quietly, and clashes spread like wildfire. There have even been reports of DACs from different factions clashing with one another.

The situation is getting more dire by the day. First, many starbases are pushing to bring “progress” to the neighboring systems. Planets that were once outside the faction’s influence are now being depleted of their resources to grease the war machine. Finally, rumor has it that Atlas secretly flows from the factions to the DACs for their service.

The Council of Peace is being pressured externally by the factions and internally by their political parties. Everyone in the galaxy is holding their breath, waiting to hear the news of what will happen next.

The cogs of fate are moving, and as time passes, some familiar faces will become entangled in events that will change the history of Star Atlas forever…

## The Macro Game Logic of Scream — Faction Galactic Domination

![Iris is awaiting. /// Triple-A Metaverse Work in Progress /// Immersive Unreal Engine 5 Experience](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/2edb6577de95d958b70b5c5c7ec5bb984abda5b79d98ffce6cee5bf1a7ecbaa0.png)

To summarize, SCREAM is about dominating different star systems for the benefit of your faction by gaining access to various resources.

The heart of SCREAM gameplay is the starbase. Starbases are structures that serve as economic and political support that allow a faction to control a given star system. The higher the tier of a starbase, the stronger the hold of a faction in that system.

Greater consolidated power from higher tier starbases enables members of the dominating faction to harvest the resources of planets farther away from the system center.

On the economic front, starbases will serve as a deposit of harvested material. As a starbase progresses through upgrades, players will be able to use it to trade and craft refined materials, creating more extensive and complex space infrastructures to support their factions in outer space.

In this sense, the creation, upgrade, attack, and defense of starbases are of utmost importance to the factions. This is true for the DACs of Star Atlas as well, as this represents a faction’s grasp of the galaxy.

The coordination of these actions, together with resource gathering and the logistics of the supply routes, constitutes the core of SCREAM gameplay loops.

## Aspects of Macro Environmental Gameplay Mechanics on SCREAM

![Summon the armies, our faction needs us. /// Triple-A Metaverse Work in Progress /// Immersive Unreal Engine 5 Experience](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/afefddd749f18dd1ae311b6ddcc3275163b6df7f8c9dc4bd252e99f9f585b563.png)

If starbases are the cornerstone of Scream, the galaxy’s environment is the game’s foundation. Every star system will be composed of planets dispersed through different locations in the star system. Each is unique, possessing different attributes that determine the materials that can be acquired from it and its overall utility in the galaxy’s economy.

Since starbase construction and defense is a demanding task, requiring that players commit substantial resources and human coordination, they must consider how the conquest of a said system will impact their faction agenda on a political and economic level. Therefore, players should analyze the planets present in each system.

In SCREAM, more than twenty types of resources will be dispersed among planets throughout the galaxy. They will obey a logic of rarity and location, meaning that some resources may be more common in a part of the universe than others.

All of these resources will have in-game utility for factions and players on their path to conquer the stars. We foresee the mobilization of factions to secure rare resources and materials found in the deeper reaches of space.

However, take care with those deep space expeditions. Otherwise, you might see yourself out of fuel — and out of options.

## Aspects of Player’s Gameplay — Exploration Logic

![Every journey starts with the first step /// Triple-A Metaverse Work in Progress /// Immersive Unreal Engine 5 Experience](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/33ddbb0d40a697e48c31d1b28c74bf74feb947334ac2e5227ee3f3791fb00b94.png)

Let’s discuss some of the mechanics of SCREAM.

The first and most prominent aspect of the gameplay logic is that as you play you will burn resources. Your fleet will need fuel to fly, toolkits to repair the damage, ammo to engage in combat, and food for the crew.

The acquisition of these resources will occur through gameplay loops. This means that players will always be fighting two silent enemies: the maintenance costs, like in SCORE, and the opportunity costs, a new addition particular to the logic of SCREAM.

Unlike SCORE, there will be no guarantees that your ship’s earnings will outweigh the maintenance costs. Instead, your contributions to the faction and your overall in-game choices will determine whether you profit or lose in your galaxy adventures.

You have no guarantee of success in your SCREAM expeditions. There is also no reward without labor. You will be facing the citizens of the galaxy who are not particularly pleased with DACs attacking their territory, and players of other factions who will be fighting to achieve the same objectives.

Most importantly, there can be only one winner in each battle. Hence, the necessity to make the best choices with the available information and coordinate your DAC’s members is a crucial aspect of SCREAM.

Don’t expect to conquer starbases by yourself.

This takes us to the next topic: How will players rally to defend their factions and spread their power? It all starts with hangars.

## Aspects of Player’s Gameplay — Hangars and loyalty

![Unknown attacker breached the system security! Deploy the fleets! /// Triple-A Metaverse Work in Progress /// Immersive Unreal Engine 5 Experience](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/bc47e32179f609a6a2e1bfeb9fa1cbdc4bdb3e134a493b3d57a4c506cbaa620f.png)

Each player that chooses to venture into the void in SCREAM will start at a hangar within their faction safe zone.

The hangars are critical structures in SCREAM, as the number of hangars a player has determines the number and class of ships the player can play.

There are also structures organized in tiers, so the higher the level of your hangar, the larger the vessel you will be able to fit in it.

Here is where things get interesting.

You will need to play and work your way into acquiring hangars that allow you to deploy certain kinds of vessels into the game, like titan ships, for example. Also, players are not permitted to purchase new hangars with Atlas.

The three factions are very sensitive to who acquires new hangars, as space is limited in their bases. Only those who have proven themselves will be allowed to expand their fleets by acquiring new hangars.

In other words, you will be given the privilege of acquiring new spaces for your fleet inside SCREAM through consistent and meaningful play in the interest of your faction.

In-game activities will bring recognition for you with your faction. You will need to work hard on this front to succeed in SCREAM.

Your standing with the factions will be measurable and, aside from helping you expand your fleet, will also serve to calculate your rewards for your services on the faction’s behalf in SCREAM along with other in-game mechanics.

Rewards will be paid to the members who serve in the SCREAM wars by epochs. As soon as an epoch ends, the faction will divide a share of the earnings of that period among the players who served. Your reward will be proportional to the value you brought to your faction via your actions with your fleet.

In other words, no payment without adding value. No glory without taking risks. SCREAM fully embodies the principles of our metaverse ambition.

## Aspects of Player’s Gameplay — Fleets and Experience

![Cargo incoming, lower the shields. /// Triple-A Metaverse Work in Progress /// Immersive Unreal Engine 5 Experience](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/b52f193d782308d50beef72cbf7529087b8451c55de0ebd96c8197d08a7c746e.png)

As we have stated, everything in SCREAM revolves around playing it. Therefore, the measurement of effort you put into the game will reflect your experience within the system.

Your progress in the experience ladder will enable you to control more fleets. This feature adds a crucial layer of complexity to SCREAM gameplay since, on later levels, this will allow you to have multiple fleets at different points of the galaxy simultaneously.

This is especially important considering that SCREAM is oriented to faction objectives. As a result, war will be fought on many different fronts, requiring players and factions to spread their armies and fleets through multiple systems and make tough choices about where and when to engage with enemy forces.

But if this wasn’t enough of a perk, experience also has other uses in SCREAM. Another impactful aspect of it is that it increases the rate at which you accrue loyalty with your faction.

The more experienced of a pilot you are, the more your feats will impact your faction, which will affect every activity that benefits your standing, such as your gains by epochs and all other features mentioned above.

## SCREAM as a Multiplayer Blockchain Native Gaming Experience

![Get back to work rascals, we have a war to fight! /// Triple-A Metaverse Work in Progress /// Immersive Unreal Engine 5 Experience](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/cd48ba91147cd83a678694ea84124bfa66ca1df150fca66d638e1052e960ec38.png)

SCREAM is unique for Star Atlas in many ways. We are particularly proud of its blockchain nature and the multiplayer aspect, laying the foundations for the complete game release.

We are proud to say that most of our features will execute and resolve on the blockchain, from attacking starbases to harvesting resources, even the location of your fleets. Every bit of game logic that has an economic impact will be safeguarded on-chain

This takes transparency, one of our core values, to a whole new level. Everything that happens in the game will be available for instant audit to everyone globally.

Another feature that we particularly enjoy is the multiplayer aspect of the game. In SCREAM, you may organically cooperate with players from your faction to fulfill the in-game objectives.

By coordinating with your guild members and the faction as a whole, you will be able to reach new heights of efficiency and success. SCREAM is heavily oriented toward multiplayer cooperativeness.

## Next Steps

There is still much to disclose about SCREAM, even on the macro level. Battle logistics, the systems of upgrades, crafting possibilities, and more will be addressed in future publications. At the same time, we’ll delve into the details of each unique feature that SCREAM offers.

We hope the information above gives you a general sense of SCREAM. As our project continues to take shape, we’ll continue to share updates.

Now, let’s see what the Punaab Whisper has for us in this edition.

## The Punaab Whisper — The Atlas Star Tabloid

Citizens of the stars! We are back for a new edition of the Punaab Whisper, featuring one of the galaxy’s favorite urban legends today: the**Wandering Caravan**!

This intrepid reporter has traveled the entire medium-risk zone searching for the (in)famous artist group, which is said to appear out of thin air — or no air at all — to perform on planets and space stations across the galaxy.

Children all over the universe dream of watching what has been described as the ‘ethereal’ performance of the group. Curiously enough, a performance has never been recorded, adding more mystery to the troupe’s very existence.

After traveling across many star systems in our Lowbie, the Truth-Seeker, we have yet to uncover any conclusive proof of their activity.

Nevertheless, we managed to acquire from a relic trader a book published after the Convergence War which gives the details, as we know them, of the itinerant group:

## The Wandering Caravan

As it’s called in the MUD language, the Wandering Caravan is a legendary artists group assembled during the Convergence Wars that performs through different regions of the cosmos.

In the places where the Wandering Caravan stops, it is always a jaw-dropping event filled with mesmerizing performances and tales from every corner of the universe. It is said this epic show can even reshape its audience’s comprehension of the limits of reality.

The Caravan is always composed of 33 different artists that wear 33 different masks. Every artist is constantly training a disciple, following the maxim that the show must always go on. Those artists come from every race in the universe, and the recruitment process is unclear.

The Caravan does not have a home to call their own, always wandering wherever the cosmic currents take them. However, some experts theorize they have a hidden yet still unknown motivation.

That’s because, in moments of enormous distress, such as the apex of the Convergence War, the Caravan suddenly seems to spawn from nowhere, snatching the hearts of the crowds with their skillful plays.

Those fortunate few who have witnessed more than one Caravan performance say that no two performances are alike.

As always, dear readers, it’s up to you to decide if this is truth or myth. We of the**Punaab Whisper** focus on presenting our community with facts, letting you draw your own conclusions!

Thank you for your support, and we hope you’ll be back for the next issue when we look at a most exotic and nearly extinct plant that is said to have a very particular property. So keep your eyes open, and have a good weekend!

ABOUT STAR ATLAS

Star Atlas is a next-gen gaming Metaverse emerging from the confluence of state of the art blockchain, real-time graphics, multiplayer video game, and decentralized financial technologies.

Real-time graphics technology using Unreal Engine 5’s Nanite allows for cinematic quality video game visuals. Blockchain technology using the [Solana](http://solana.com) protocol establishes a largely serverless and secured gameplay experience. Non-fungible tokens obtained and traded within Star Atlas create an economy that replicates the tangibility of real world assets and ownership.
