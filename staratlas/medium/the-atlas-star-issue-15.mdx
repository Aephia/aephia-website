*A tale about building a new world…*

![The time for Action has Come. /// A Metaverse in Expansion in The Showroom /// We Are Star Atlas](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/e084aa9453474b61662cc365c92d3c767feaac63d92340a0a04b3791ed18cf6a.png)

Welcome to a fresh episode of the Atlas Star, the galactic newspaper of record!

In our previous edition, we bid farewell to 2022 by recapping all the memorable events that took place last year. Now, it’s time to gaze into the future and reveal what 2023 has in store for the Star Atlas metaverse.

Read on and learn about our roadmap with the upcoming releases for all public projects, from the main Unreal Engine 5 game module to SAGE and more.

We also discuss the latest developments in the Star Atlas ecosystem, including through the Punaab Whisper, the Atlas Brew, and all else related to Star Atlas.

Make yourself comfortable, put the tune of a Sogmian Ballad on in the background, and enjoy the sight of seeing your favorite metaverse materializing before your eyes.

## The Unreal Star Atlas 2023: A Multiplayer Adventure with Ground Racing, Fighting, and more

![The Calico Scud Spaceship /// A Metaverse in Light Speed Expansion /// We Are Star Atlas](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/89f69f8262a97ad4cd8ac4369d37b932905598b4f72b2ac4aa1f0c290f7ceecc.png)

In 2022, our collective vision of building the ultimate metaverse MMO manifested itself on the plane of reality with the release of the Showroom, the Star Atlas DAO, the F-KIT, CORE and a glimpse into SAGE through yet-unreleased blockchain contracts and a game manual. All of those paved the way for what is to come. Now, in 2023, we are creating engaging multiplayer experiences that will enable everyone sharing the frontier of the future with us to have fun while testing the limits of technological development itself.

This is a year of building together with our community, and we have many exciting features in our galactic pipeline being prepared for you.

Let us start by analyzing what is coming in the next modules of the Showroom, also known as R2.1 and R2.2 — and don’t get deceived by those incremental numbers.

An ancient and almost forgotten MUD saying states that *a picture is worth a thousand words, and a moving picture is worth a thousand pictures*, so let’s introduce this next update with a small peek into the future — a video of the upgraded UE5 environment:

Although the video itself is beautiful and intuitively self-explanatory (perhaps those MUD ancestors were right in their estimation of the medium’s worth), let us walk through some of the finer details of the plans for our future releases.

First of all, in R2.1, we are moving the Showroom itself to the latest stable Unreal Engine 5.1 version, a tangible update that allows us to improve the user experience even more by adding world partition, offering the prospect of experiencing a seamless, endless world without any loading screens.

This update will also fix existing game bugs, such as the infinite speed glitch, while also introducing a real flight trainer to refine your piloting skills!

Finally, we are striving to bring six new flyable ships with polished interiors into the UE5 environment: The Opal Jet, the Opal JetJet, the Opal JetJetJet, the Fimbul Lowbie, the Pearce X6, the Fimbul Airbike, and the Fimbul BYOS Packlite (spot the intruder in the bunch).

This update is also expected to increase the *performance* of the entire build, making your experience in the metaverse much smoother! As all roads lead to UE5, here’s another big change: We are integrating the now web-based Galactic Marketplace together with the Showroom, allowing you to buy your spaceships and fly them around in real time, all done within Unreal Engine.

Now, let’s move to everyone’s favorite idea of fun: game loops.

One of the most exciting revelations in our latest Town Hall was a *ground racing game*. Although we are tentatively planning to launch it as early as R2.1, the product team may elect to ship it to the [Epic Games Store](https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/star-atlas-bead34) with more polish in the R2.2 release.

With this update, the game is getting competitive multiplayer *ground* racing. We are building an exciting 8-player racing track for you and seven other friends to zoom through and blast each other in the immersive landscape surrounding Volant Station.

You will be able to shoot your competitors and disable them while dodging and accelerating across the Showroom. The races will get serious (and seriously fun), and we sense many deadly and entertaining tournaments on the horizon.

Another feature we are tentatively looking to deploy in R2.2 or earlier in R2.1 is a top community favorite, *Jetpacks*.

As seen in the video above, it will enable everyone to fly around — Iron Man style. This will allow even players who currently don’t own any ships of their own to have fun exploring the limits of Volant Station.

As alluded to previously, the feature scope of R2.2 will have a massive improvement in the infrastructure side of the Showroom. How massive? We hope to provide our community with dedicated high-performance game servers that allow from **four hundred to one thousand players** in a single instance.

This way, you will be able to reunite your whole guild and have fun blasting each other!

Finally, we aim to release Showroom R3 during Solana Breakpoint towards the end of the year. Although we don’t want to spoil any surprises, we can share that the focus of R3 will be PVP features, coupled with on-chain rewards and the construction of the enormous and mysterious Warp Gate one can see in the skies above the station.

One final clue about what else is to come in R3 is hiding in the video below:

## Star Atlas Golden Era: The Galia Expanse Chessboard is Coming to Life

![The Golden Era is coming. /// A Metaverse in expansion in The Showroom /// We Are Star Atlas](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/20d59c455c955e3fd8f524e58e40036e18b46fef148276993a59af6f0722c958.png)

A unique game that relies on the coordination and intelligence of players and their guilds, built on the Solana blockchain in its entirety, accessible to all with any web browser, and offering an unforgettable cross-section of free market economy, politics, and the gripping lore of the Galia Expanse.

This is the promise for Star Atlas Golden Era, a.k.a. SAGE, a promise whose delivery starts through a movement and coordinate system test.

SAGE is state-of-the-art technology using Solana blockchain smart contracts, and in its underlying structure it contains six founding contracts that enable the dream of a metaverse MMO with a real economy to come to life, each one representing a complex gameplay aspect:

- 1. Movement and Coordinate Systems
- 2. Combat
- 3. Mining
- 4. Crafting
- 5. Inventory Management
- 6. Player Progression

The first point of order is to stress test the Movement and Coordinate System contract, and there is a lot more you will be hearing about this endeavor as development intensifies — don’t worry, you’re the first in line to try this world-first achievement in action. This test phase could last until the spatial system is perfectly calibrated.

The next ones to follow will be the Mining and Crafting contracts, followed by the Combat protocols — one of the most awaited features.

Whatever the case may be, we have a spot reserved for you in this next stage of development!

## The DAO and the Guilds: The Social and Political Layers of Star Atlas

![The Polisticians Forum. /// A Metaverse in expansion in The Showroom /// We Are Star Atlas](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/b920d937a4a72a50914a8a67896458f57491f97e0e38a4b9ed2c0c47b01b0266.png)

The Star Atlas metaverse comprises many different layers of gaming experience. Two of them, the social and political ones, have captivated the heart of the community, which has been anxiously waiting for the game structures of those two dimensions of Star Atlas to connect.

We are happy to announce that in 2023, those two aspects of our metaverse will intertwine and blossom together.

In the Star Atlas DAO, we have created an extensive legislative process for proposals to be evaluated and voted on by our community members with POLIS voting power (PVP).

We have created a nine-step procedure that will allow ample participation by all of our politically engaged members to have their voices heard — and considered — in the process of using the DAO’s power to shape the direction of the metaverse. The POLISticians will be able to commence their careers in Star Atlas this year, and you can expect comprehensive articles and discussions about it going forward.

On the social front, another mechanism shines, bringing various tools for coordinating and functionalities for the guilds of Star Atlas, a platform for the Decentralized Autonomous Corporations (DACs).

While we await the DAC platform blockchain program to complete its audit, you should already anticipate for this guild registration application to allow for a variety of interesting features for your in-game organization, such as:

- Member management through a protocol that allows you to officially register your DAC before the Council of Peace and invite or exclude members.
- Creation of ranks and hierarchies within the DAC, working together with other features to allow different levels of access to the DAC assets and spaces.
- The creation of improved leaderboards that will also integrate DAC scores in the future.

We are currently in the phase of wrapping up the work on the DAC user experience and we are hoping to align this release with the SAGE tech demo.

The introduction of those two new layers of gaming experience to Star Atlas is a perfect mix with the other programs in development in 2023. Before the end of this year, our community will be able to enjoy the vibrant and rich ecosystem of Star Atlas on all fronts, where politics, economy, social, military, and blockchain aspects of our game meld into the ultimate experience.

## The Punaab Whisper — The Atlas Star Tabloid

![Concept art of Tenebra /// Triple-A Metaverse Work in Progress /// Immersive Unreal Engine 5 Experience.](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/0a00cf2ba03e193bb449ec425953b4768ac480a7d87fb050c6b34a8642d51143.png)

My Dear Readers! Today, the Punaab Whisper is taking a darker turn, for we are investigating the tales about one of the most mysterious worlds in the inner reaches of the galaxy, the planet aptly known as *Tenebra*.

Known only by a few explorers and even fewer scientists, presumably due to its hard-to-spot nature, Tenebra is a mysterious secluded planet in the high-risk zone, filled with a strange gaseous lower orbit that reflects less than 1% of the light that it receives.

It’s a puzzle that the galaxy has yet to solve.

Very close to totally uncharted territory, Tenebra is located in a system popularly known as the Void, which is said to be home to unspeakable stories about the populations of all the other worlds in the system being abducted and taken to Tenebra to be used as slaves or worse, living sacrifices to whatever forces dwell beyond the dark veil.

This enigma caused much concern to the regional powers of the inner galactic zones, to the point where one of the most well-paid positions in the galaxy became that of a data runner hired to find information about the said planet — unfortunately, according to our sources, much less than 5% of those return to collect the reward.

Even those adventurers who manage to come back cannot share much. The dark gas that fills the planet hinders the effects of the scans, but what every one of them confirms on their mission is that something must be happening under the gaseous surface of that world…

This is inferred from the unconventional energy displays that sometimes appear as blood-red marks in the planet’s atmosphere, only observable at close distances, hypothesized to be a sub-product of chemical reactions and high energy outputs coming from construction-related activities.

Nevertheless, economic costs, extreme distances, and political discussions have stopped anyone from acting on Tenebra, as whatever is happening there is still contained in the Void.

Perhaps it is only a matter of time for that to change.

As the galaxy’s foremost whistleblower, we are writing this article to bring awareness of the still ongoing situation in the Void system and, hopefully, help steer the Council of Peace to send a mission to the planet and learn the truth of what is going on before it is too late.

If the rumors are true, Tenebra and whoever controls it must be stopped immediately.

## **Updates**

In the second part of the Atlas Star, we summarize the latest updates and events since the last publication.
