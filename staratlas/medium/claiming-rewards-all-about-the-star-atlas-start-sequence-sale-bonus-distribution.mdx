The time is nigh to claim your status as a true galactic pioneer and collect your perks from the SAGE Start Sequence Sales.

The original buyers who participated in the **Golden Era Start Sequence Campaign** thus far ([Phase I](https://medium.com/star-atlas/star-atlas-golden-era-start-sequence-our-path-towards-tomorrow-cb7d51f19c84) and/or [Phase II](https://medium.com/star-atlas/cosmic-overture-begins-land-and-claim-stakes-up-for-grabs-in-phase-2-of-sage-start-sequence-f47fa9f2f6c3)) and acquired the selected assets sold by ATMTA until January 31 at 12 PM EST are soon receiving their trailblazing rewards for participating in this special one-time event.

**Due to the complexity of deployment of the high number of assets, the release of the rewards is targeted for between today, February 10, and Monday, February 13, 2023.** The availability of rewards will be announced on the official Star Atlas [Twitter](https://twitter.com/staratlas) and[ Discord](https://discord.gg/staratlas).

After this release, every original buyer will be able to claim the rewards coming from the purchases in the Start Sequence sales phases from their inventory at [Play.StarAtlas.com](https://play.staratlas.com/). The Start Sequence consisted of exclusive ship inventory sold on discount, a fraction of the Factions Central Space Station residential land plots, and a batch of Claim Stakes, all much-needed resources for colonizing deep space planets of SAGE.

This is the next step in the journey towards releasing SAGE and unveiling Galia expanse while offering players the chance to earn valuable rewards and experiences.

### **SAFETY FIRST — WATCH OUT FOR SCAMMERS:**

- There will be only one website to claim the rewards: [Play.StarAtlas.com](https://play.staratlas.com/).
- Carefully verify the website address before accessing it
- Know that you will never be contacted about the rewards distribution by the Star Atlas team or its members via a direct message on any platform.
- You won’t get any rewards automatically dropped to your wallet — treat any tokens you receive without claiming them yourself with suspicion.

## **THE BOUNTIFUL START SEQUENCE REWARDS LIST**

### **REWARDS TO BE AVAILABLE AT A LATER DATE**

In summary, the only assets that will not be claimable this time (between Friday, February 10, and Monday, February 13) are the ones related to the whitelisting for the physical plot selection in the Central Space Stations and the commercial areas sales whitelist. Those will be available to eligible players once we are closer to the time of the selection and sales of the respective plots.

## **Immediate Spaceship Utility in Faction Fleet**

Aside from all assets being immediately available for bartering in the Galactic Marketplace, players will find that the ships claimed from the Start Sequence purchases will be immediately available for use in the Faction Fleet (SCORE) gameplay feature, rewarding them ATLAS for being sent into service of the respective Star Atlas faction.

The Claim Stakes R4 earnings in Faction Fleet, offsetting the costs of a ship based on the Tier of the Claim Stake, is targeted to be available in early March 2023. Their principal utilities, together with the Mining Drills and Power Plants, are entwined with the deployment of the mining and colonizing mechanics in SAGE, which is part of our roadmap ahead.

The other items directly related to the Central Space Station Land Plots, such as the habs, paint, and other related items, will also have their full utility on display with the release of the Central Space Stations environments in an upcoming Unreal Engine 5 game module.

### **FINAL SAFETY WARNING:**

**Again, please stay safe and keep your assets secure by verifying the authenticity of web links, messages and blockchain assets you receive.**

**Star Atlas will make Start Sequence rewards available on one website only ( [https://play.staratlas.com](https://play.staratlas.com/)), and will not airdrop any of the assets directly to users’ wallets, nor will the Star Atlas team be contacting individual eligible users via direct messages.**
