*Support for Ledger’s secure digital asset storage devices is now available for the Unreal Engine 5 powered Star Atlas Showroom, DAO Lockers, [Galactic Marketplace](http://play.staratlas.com/market), Fleet Viewer, and Faction Fleet.*

![Star Atlas Ledger cold storage in UE5 /// Star Atlas Showroom — Pre-Alpha Demo /// Immersive Blockchain Powered Experience](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/f9638f18caafa7e206ee9051e944f9d2e5db1435373d1e61e0a89133355c3427.jpeg)

[Star Atlas](http://Play.staratlas.com/), a next-gen gaming experience on the Solana blockchain, powered by triple-A Unreal Engine 5 (UE5) available on the [Epic Games Store](https://store.epicgames.com/p/star-atlas-bead34), announced full support for Ledger cold storage solutions across its entire ecosystem, including for several of the most popular hardware devices like the Ledger Nano X and the Ledger Nano S.

The new functionality offers players in Star Atlas to play the game and access the entire line of products with maximum security in mind.

> Michael Wagner, CEO of ATMTA, Inc. and co-founder of Star Atlas, added: “The peace of mind that Ledger provides is fundamental to securing the sustainable and thriving Star Atlas ecosystem, a self-sovereign socioeconomic order we are building for all participants to benefit from.

Players who already have access to the pre-alpha Showroom on the [Epic Games Store](https://store.epicgames.com/p/star-atlas-bead34) will be able to access the functionality after downloading and applying the latest game patch. All Solana-based derivation paths are currently supported.

The UE5-powered Showroom is a highly-anticipated first playable experience in Star Atlas. It was released at the 426LIVE:NYK event on September 29, 2022 along with several other products. Among them is the opensource F-KIT, a software development kit (SDK) that is built into the Showroom and bridges UE5 access to the Solana blockchain.

Players can also safely access ATLAS & POLIS Lockers, the Galactic Marketplace, Fleet Viewer, the Faction Fleet (SCORE) and their Showroom game keys.

The Showroom is live on the [Epic Games Store (EGS)](https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/star-atlas-bead34) as a closed pre-alpha release and to gain access, you’ll need a key.

### Access to Showroom Keys

Keys are distributed based on your [Faction Fleet](https://play.staratlas.com/fleet) badge. The higher the badge, the more keys you receive. If you’ve enrolled your ships in faction fleet for at least 7 days and have the Seasoned Fleet badge, you’ll be receiving a key. The pre-alpha game keys for the Star Atlas Showroom can be found on the Profile page that can be accessed by clicking above “wallet connected” in play.staratlas.com. Once you are in the profile page, you will see a “claim game keys” button at the top right of the screen. Below, you’ll find a graphic displaying the details on how many keys each Faction Fleet badge tier receives.
