*A tale about building a new world…*

![The Wheels of The Galactic Economy Never Stop Spinning /// A Metaverse in Expansion /// The Showroom Work in Progress](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/c9971b72370cef7b303d78acc688af6b60893fa1c9f8369e96260070389935b9.png)

Welcome, Explorers from all corners of the galaxy! Your galactic news source of record is back with another epic edition to discuss one of our community’s favorite topics: The economy.

In this issue, we are discussing the rationale behind Star Atlas’s decentralized economy, walking through our high-level vision of how users will be able to acquire resources, craft in-game assets, trade them, acquire goods and services, and much more of the basic game structures.

Also, in this edition, you will learn about the latest developments in the Star Atlas ecosystem, including our news channel, the *Punaab Whisper*, the sacred community event, the *Atlas Brew*, and all else related to Star Atlas.

We are nearing another exciting time in Star Atlas development, so fasten your seat belt and get ready for take-off. We are about to hit warp speed.

## A Top-Level Vision Of The Star Atlas Metaverse Economic System

![Mining Rigs on the Space Frontier /// A Metaverse in Light Speed Expansion /// We Are Star Atlas](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/58d37a5de2d287c4a06ef4fa8c7573ea3c26a91db69599133a3cbdef23934ec4.png)

Inflation, growth, monetary policy, supply chains, and consumer behavior — these concepts are not usually associated with games pertaining to the realm of economics and economic analysis. Nevertheless, Star Atlas, through its economics department, is harnessing those concepts and several other instruments of the economic theory literature in order to build the ultimate gaming experience.

If you have been following us for a while now, you know that Star Atlas metaverse aims to recreate the most exciting aspects of real-life economics. We are creating an entire universe, full of scarce resources and planets to conquer, which will allow players to compete, collaborate and experiment in order to fulfill their personal agendas, literally building from the ground extensive galactic empires and civilizations.

Manifesting this vision is enhanced by our blockchain architecture, which makes every in-game asset a potential property in-game, with players being able to have many options for what to do with these assets — even destroying them forever.

This beautiful horizon requires extensive work — a special type of analytical work that prevents the Star Atlas economy from going into an inflationary death spiral or becoming a dry desert of liquidity, impeding trading and growth and sharing the fate of many countries in Earth’s history.

That’s the mission of our economists, and today you will learn some of the mechanics they use to create a thriving ecosystem for our players to enjoy their assets inside the game to the fullest, focusing specifically on the “Achilles Heel” of most MMO’s games, the introduction of raw resources in the economy.

Come with us on a journey to the realm of *effort* and *value*.

## The Economic Journey For Raw Materials Extraction in The Star Atlas Metaverse

![Populating Your Own World /// A Metaverse in Light Speed Expansion /// We Are Star Atlas](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/a15ebdf90fd873c0df479f0f9d6ffeb7db1b0e52a9cb5a890c467047a1032ba3.png)

The beginning of our journey comes from the premise that informs the whole architecture of Star Atlas economics: *“Nothing comes from the void. All in-game assets are the result of the effort, investment of time, and dedication of players.”*

What this premise tells us is that once Star Atlas economy starts to function, all in-game assets will come from the player’s efforts. If you want to have a ship, you will need to find the component to build it, acquire the expertise to assemble it, and expend time and resources into building it.

In this edition, you will see the first part of this enormous economic loop and how players can acquire the raw resources to build everything the Star Atlas metaverse offers. We will walk you through the first part of this variable, which informs the offer side of the economic equation of the game, preventing players from acquiring raw materials in a frenetic manner that overwhelms demand and growth, which would turn all the assets in the game useless

Now, without delay, let us start discussing the framework of the raw materials acquisition.

Once we kick-start our economic loops, everything inside Star Atlas, from cooking meals to feed your crew members to repairing damaged ships and constructing enormous star bases to rule a star system, will require specific basic raw materials to be done.

Obtaining those raw resources is the most fundamental task for those envisioning a career inside Star Atlas economic structures, and it will require players to create appropriate infrastructure, deploying time, capital, and labor while also having the proper storage, security, and management of their operations.

Let us go through each one of those steps, starting with the infrastructure aspect.

Most of the resources you will find in Star Atlas won’t be lying down on the floor, waiting to be picked up by an adventurer while doing their evening walk. They will require players to create the means for their production or harvesting in the form of infrastructure.

A good example of this is how mining operations function. To mine resources over a planet, players will first need to claim a territory using enormous structures named [Claim Stakes](https://play.staratlas.com/market/?category=structure&itemClass=stake), which will be responsible for establishing the conditions for the basic infrastructure inside.

Those claim stakes, in turn, support a number of pieces of planetary infrastructure according to their tier, such as power plants, mining drills, farms, shields, and defenses, amongst others, meaning that your first strategic decision will be about balancing productivity output versus security or variety.

Star Atlas is an open and organic world where many bad events can affect the results of your operations, such as:

- Your claim stakes can be attacked by players and NPCs, which will directly impact production yields and demand supplementary investment in form of repairs, defense, and opportunity costs.
- The prices of the different commodities in Star Atlas fluctuate with the open market, especially the one where your Star System is located, which causes uncertainty in terms of prices.
- All planetary operations in the medium and safe zones of the galaxy are subject to taxation from the regional government of the Star System, generating costs that, if not observed, may cause loss of land.

All of those systems make it very possible that, in certain circumstances, the whole operation might not be profitable, especially if there is an overflow on the offer side of a product inside the Star System, which will incentivize a shift of production from the owners of claim stakes, creating an equilibrium in the offer.

Nevertheless, even after creating the necessary infrastructure, you will need to keep it supplied with a working force and every resource necessary for their work support, such as food, fuel, ammo, and toolkits, so that your operation can function properly.

This adds another layer of management and risk since crew members can be attacked, can be affected by environmental circumstances, or simply fail to do their jobs properly by a lack of skill or motivation.

## The Variety of Resources

Then the fun part begins: The harvesting of the resource. Galia Expanse, the Star Atlas galaxy, is filled with a variety of resources, ranging from common ones, which are mostly found in any star system, to anomaly classes, which can only be acquired in very special conditions in high-risk environments.

When we look at specific resource harvesting, interesting aspects join our analysis. Different resource scarcity inside the game is controlled by three variables, two on the economic front and one of the game design.

### Variable I:**Resource Richness**

The first one of those is called**Resource Richness.**

**Resource Richness** is the measurement of how likely you are to find resources in a certain area and how bountiful they are. The game logic is oriented toward making the most inaccessible and dangerous zones the ones with a higher resource richness number, mainly due to the fact that they have been less explored and most of its natural resources are still there, waiting for those daring enough to acquire them.

Another important aspect is that the closer you are to the inner and most dangerous parts of our galaxy, the more the planets you are visiting receive the influence of Iris, and it’s common knowledge among explorers that Iris influence bends the law of reality to some extent, creating, sometimes, unique veins and resources.

So, if you are exploring regions with a low degree of resource richness, the variety and abundance of resources will impact the possible output of your operation due to lower yields of production.

### Variable II: Resource Hardness

The second aspect that will influence your journey while extracting resources is**Resource Hardness**.

This aspect measures how hard it’s in terms of time spent to gather the resource from the source and load it in your ships or storage. To explain this concept, the economy team came up with the analogy of the “size of the straw.” Imagine you have a whole lake filled with good water, but you can only use a coffee stir to take the water from the lake into your mouth. It will take a good amount of time to quench your thirst, which will demand you to spend a long time on this activity.

Some resources in Star Atlas will have a high degree of hardness, meaning that your crewmembers will have a hard time extracting them, so they will give you a lower yield per unit of time.

### Variable III:**Appropriate Skill Proficiency**

Finally, the last variable, which will come in a farther away future than the two already presented, will be**Appropriate Skill Proficiency**.

Some of the materials that inhabit the depths of the Galia Expanse planets will require specialized work. You will need to allocate personnel with the proper experience and skill set to manage the extraction operations of most of the rare resources in our galaxy. This is measured in the game by our**careers system**.

In Star Atlas, crew members are able to learn different skill specializations, such as mining. As long as they train their skills by acquiring experience in their fields, they can reach new thresholds of knowledge, allowing them to engage in bigger and more complex challenges in their respective areas.

Keeping our examples in the mining field, at the start of your career as a miner, even working on iron veins, will prove difficult and exhausting for your crew member. Nevertheless, should he keep on training in-game and accruing experiences related to mining, he will learn the tricks of the trade and will be able to mine rare crystals like *Lumanite* in the depths of the medium zone one day.

Now that we understand those variables, you can see that there is a lot of effort and time going into simply extracting those resources from the ground. Nevertheless, those efforts and investments are what make those resources valuable and meaningful in the game since they are the basis of how the economy works.

Still, we only touched the tip of the iceberg as there are still lots of variables that influence the first part of the economic equation of Star Atlas: The offer side. In our next edition, we will discuss another main component of the offer side. The supply chain that enables the raw materials to reach out to crafters and developers throughout the galaxy!

Now, let’s see what everyone’s favorite reporter has been up to in the Punaab Whisper.

## The Punaab Whisper — The Atlas Star Tabloid

![A Herald of Vignus — Derivative Concept Art /// Obtained by the Punaab Whisper](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/622e33bcb4f616cefb8f0cfc1988b49a4a556aa77ac7ad37c072caf120af0a36.jpeg)

My Dear Readers! Today, the Punaab Whisper is investigating another interesting group in our galaxy, the self-proclaimed servants of fate, the *Heralds of God Vignus*.

“Well, we are basically on a mission from our god to deliver fate to those who must learn about it. Everyone is born with a destiny, but not everyone’s fate is relevant enough to make me lose my time visiting them. Nevertheless, while we search for the ones touched by destiny, the ever so merciful Vignus allows us to make good ATLAS by sharing shards of the fate of the inexpressive masses.”

This was the opening quote one of the heralds gave us when we asked them about what his group occupations were.

After further research, we learned that the Heralds of Vignus is the name of a group whose characteristics vary widely depending on who you ask: From prophets and augurs to drunks, swindlers, and heretics. The children of Vignus, as they call themselves, roam the galaxy cashing certain individuals and also sharing their curious prophecies with whoever manages to strike a deal with them.

The two rules of their trade are well known in the folklore of the galaxy.

**The first rule**: No revelation is given for free, and one shall pay a fair price as established by the herald.

**The second rule:** Once given, one cannot avoid encountering their fate.

The “liturgy” of the prophecy also seems to follow a set pattern. First, the mythic sits together with the seeker, sends a prayer for fate, licks the palm of the seeker, and delivers the prophecy.

This last part depends on the herald. Some proclaim poetry; some draw a painting, sing a song, or write a single word.

More often than not, the prophecy is so general that it’s irrelevant, which usually amuses the herald, who will shrug and laugh at the boring fate of the seeker.

This usually doesn’t end well, giving bad fame to the heralds. In some worlds, they are outright banned from entering, and there are cases of heralds being beaten to death after delivering a “bad prophecy.”

Nevertheless, the common folk seems to believe in the power of Vignus, and most of them try not to engage with the heralds as if fate can be avoided by preventing its reading.

This Punaab of yours tried to strike a deal with the fortune teller but, unfortunately, was dismissed with an enigmatic denial: It’s still not the right time.

While we await “the right time,” the Punaab Whisper will keep investigating this suspicious group, which seems to live up to the worst names they are called for.

Thank you for your patronage, as usual, and keep your eyes open for the next edition of your favorite reporter publication!
