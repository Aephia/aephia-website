ATMTA, the leading developers of *Star Atlas*, is thrilled to announce a strategic partnership with [SingularityNET](https://singularitynet.io/), a founding member of the [Artificial Superintelligence (ASI) Alliance](https://superintelligence.io). This collaboration marks a pivotal opportunity in our journey to build the most immersive gaming metaverse by integrating **advanced Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)** into the *Star Atlas* ecosystem.

Following our [recent partnership with Shaga](https://medium.com/star-atlas/atmta-announces-strategic-equity-investment-in-shaga-to-enhance-star-atlas-accessibility-037b651761e2) to ensure accessibility to high-fidelity gaming for all players, we’re now taking another significant leap towards innovation. By collaborating with SingularityNET, we’re applying state-of-the-art AI technology to *Star Atlas*, seeking to enhance the depth and interactivity of our universe on the Solana blockchain and testing the limits of AI technology in gaming.

This partnership explores the potential of AGI to transform *Star Atlas* and, by extension, the broader gaming industry. We’re harnessing SingularityNET’s **AIRIS (Autonomous Intelligent Reinforcement Inferred Symbolism)** experiential learning system to introduce AI-driven Non-Player Characters (NPCs), virtual companions, and advanced AI agents. These innovations aim to enhance player experience, support in-game progression, and optimize our thriving economy, which already generates over $2 million monthly in virtual GDP.

Let us walk you through the main highlights of this partnership.

**Key Initiatives Driving Our Vision**

Together with SingularityNET, we’re focusing on exploring the following advancements:

- **AI-Driven NPCs:** Powered by AIRIS, we are pushing to develop the next generation of NPCs. The idea is that they will evolve beyond static roles, learning and adapting to player actions. These dynamic characters and in-game factions will enrich the *Star Atlas* universe, creating a more responsive and engaging experience.
- **Virtual Companions:** We’re laying the foundation for AI assistants that support players’ journeys, leveraging the ASI Innovation Stack to refine their capabilities and utility over time.
- **Advanced AI Agents:** We are working to create agents that will streamline trading and resource management within our multi-token economy, ensuring efficiency and scalability as *Star Atlas* continues to grow.

Looking ahead, integrating frameworks like AIRIS and the OpenCog Hyperon AGI system is poised to enhance gameplay and strengthen the ASI: Create platform. This will empower developers to craft new interactive possibilities, aligning with our vision of a metaverse that evolves with its community.

**Leadership Perspectives**

**Dr. Ben Goertzel**, founder of the ASI Alliance and CEO of SingularityNET, shared his insights:

*“Star Atlas offers an incredible opportunity to bring advanced AI into a vibrant, player-driven universe — where AI agents don’t just serve the game, but grow with it. By embedding SingularityNET frameworks like AIRIS and OpenCog Hyperon into Web3 gameplay, we’re not only enriching the user experience — we’re advancing the co-evolution between humans and AIs in a virtual world that, as it develops, will increasingly mirror the complex dynamics of the real one. By building this on Solana and Sophiaverse and within the ASI Alliance ecosystem, we’re demonstrating how decentralized networks and token economies can accelerate the path toward superintelligence while empowering global developer and player communities.”*

**Michael Wagner**, CEO of ATMTA, Inc., commented:

*“We are about delivering a fully immersive experience, and exploring ways to leverage AI in Star Atlas’s expansive universe and lore. Imagine AI agents partnering with players to provide support across onboarding, progression, seasonal quests, and enabling our rich economy with player tools, even scaling and expanding the many worlds and personalization opportunities of Star Atlas. Integrating advanced AI is about building the ultimate world-building moments and celebrating players in our dynamic, decentralized ecosystem.”*

**Pioneering a New Frontier**

We’ve built *Star Atlas* to push boundaries, establishing a sustainable blockchain economy where players mine resources, trade, and govern through a multi-token system. This partnership starts a development expedition that amplifies that foundation, merging advanced AI with Solana’s blockchain to create a digital universe that responds to every interaction. From NPCs adapting to your choices to agents participating in our economy, we’re redefining what’s possible in gaming.

This collaboration is just the beginning. Together with [SingularityNET](https://singularitynet.io/) and all our other partners, we’re laying the groundwork for a future where decentralized frameworks drive the evolution of gaming.
