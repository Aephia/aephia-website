## What are Crew Packs?

Crew Packs are the next addition to our gaming ecosystem, featuring randomly generated crew members that unlock new game mechanics through SAGE Starbased and beyond.

Players can acquire followers with diverse traits, personalities, and skills to support their fleets and infrastructures. They will also become your in-game avatars, allowing you to perform the various gameplay loops and ultimately affecting your efficiency in them as new game expansions introduce crew progression systems and careers.

Finally, crew members are categorized into rarity tiers, similar to Star Atlas’ ship rarity system, from common to anomaly tier. Higher rarity crew members are granted aptitudes in increased quantity and power, allowing them to gain experience faster in their areas of expertise.

## Natural Talents and Tendencies — The Different Aptitudes

![](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/5b3fa519123cf5aae3d1f57807ca1c4f4e6c32ba9c25ed4ba47d793197b20b8f.png)

Talking about gameplay elements, let’s dive into something our captains are surely eager to know about: The different areas of expertise, or as they are known in-game, aptitudes that their crew can specialize in.

There are seven different crew aptitudes guiding your crew members’ innate talents and abilities development:

- **Command:** This aptitude increases the crew’s experience gained when assigned to the Admiral, Commander, and Captain’s roles.
- **Flight:** This aptitude increases the crew’s experience gained when assigned to the Navigator and Pilot’s role.
- **Engineering:** This aptitude increases the crew’s experience gained when assigned to Engineering roles.
- **Medical:** This aptitude increases the crew’s experience gained when assigned to Medical roles.
- **Scientist:** This aptitude increases the crew’s experience gained when assigned to Science roles.
- **Operator:** This aptitude increases the crew’s experience gained when assigned to the Weapons Operator, Drone Operator, and Rig Operator roles.
- **Hospitality:** This aptitude increases the crew’s experience gained when assigned to various support roles such as: Chef, Mixologist, Entertainer, Clerical Officer, Security, Manager, Foreman, and Janitor.

It goes without saying that having crew members with natural aptitudes linked with your fleet specialization and composition is a huge positive factor in the success of your galactic endeavors, so make sure to pay attention to how you choose your talent!

## A Tale of Genius and Ordinary Folks — The Different Rarity Tiers of Crew Members and Its Importance

![](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/624a8c1a852e564dfac2aef993a7231d6fa721a41ee43982cfd83b479a24ff8f.png)

Crew members are divided into rarity tiers that mirror Star Atlas’ overall ship rarity system, ranging from common crew members to anomaly-tier followers. The rarer your crew is, the more diverse and potent their aptitudes are, gaining experience points at a flat rate faster.

You can see the different aptitude bonuses that each crew rarity tier has in the image below:

![](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/70ee331894e736e768c3cfe23f46c0111af626291cf73c86e3846459ef018b17.png)

As you can see, higher-rarity crew members have the advantage of filling more efficiently different in-game roles due to their many and more intense aptitudes. Nevertheless, it is important not to underestimate common crew members in well-placed positions. Strategy, patience, and hard work may very well overcome talent!

## Level UP! — Introducing The Perks System and Character Progression System in Star Atlas

![](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/b23170cd2a1db5b29bea9c3d255367c5cdbb85898df6142fba0db92771377dcf.jpeg)

Now that you understand how your crew members’ natural inclinations and talents work, let us show you how your hard work in training them will pay off.

Crew member progression is the backbone of the Star Atlas RPG system. As your crew members work on tasks related to their various in-game aptitudes, they will earn experience points and level up in those specific areas.

Every level they gain will generate an expandable point on the specific Aptitude Perk Tier System (APTS). This system, tied with the development of each aptitude category, allows you to unlock specific crew-related perks, providing bonuses that stack within a ship.

This way, you can mold your crew members’ progression in many different ways, combining the bonuses of different APTS to maximize your ship’s efficiency. For example, your Punaab Captain could focus on acquiring the Resource Management perk in the Command APTS while later also developing the Provisioning perk in the Hospitality APTS for maximum food usage efficiency.

Since all crew members can learn all in-game perks, the possibilities are endless, limited only by your hard work and dedication! Also, it’s important to note that there is no “max level cap” on any of the in-game perks, just diminishing returns on the benefits of spending more and more points on a given perk.

We bet you are extremely curious to see the many different perks your crew can acquire, so feel free to dig into the image below:

![](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/b3c600140e68b621286a15172afcbef65542b802b0f2fac8b895a4b6e81b282b.png)

As shown in the image, each APTS has four different perks available, which you can choose to spend your points on. Notice that some perks only unlock at higher levels, like Reflex on the Operator APTS, which requires you to level up in this APTS before you can spend points on that perk.

Fear not, though. You can save your points as you level up and use them all on the perk you want, or you can spread them across different perks as you progress. Also, although we don’t want to spoil too many surprises, there might be re-specking mechanics for perk points, as long as some conditions based on location, fees, and specialists with certain skills are met.

The choice is yours on how to mold your crew!

Another important detail is that perks have different effects in different Star Atlas environments, so make sure to plan accordingly to maximize your efficiency in both SAGE and Unreal environments.

Last but not least, although we are as eager as you to start training our crew members in the different progression paths, bear in mind that the implementation of the leveling mechanics and progression systems will follow the development of the overall Star Atlas roadmap. All these mechanics are subject to change as development progresses.

Regardless, the progression and experience systems are some of the most exciting parts of the crew mechanics gameplay. We will introduce them into our gaming ecosystem as soon as we complete the MVP!

## Get To Work! — The Different Utilities For Crew Members Now and In The Future

![](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/8eb9bdb8e4ad5b048dcfac40f5f19cb0adc8eeaee4df000c50c1a4bcb3b37dbf.png)

The deployment of crew members in Star Atlas’ gaming ecosystem brings immediate new use cases and forms the basis for many future gaming mechanics.

As soon as you acquire your crew member, you will also get a new worker to perform crafting jobs in the Star Atlas SAGE [Starbased game](https://based.staratlas.com/), allowing you to pump your supply chain efficiency in-game. Also, the crew art serves as your Star Atlas Player Profile Picture (PFP), allowing you to represent your favorite species and faction both inside and outside our ecosystem.

Nevertheless, crew members truly shine as the next in-game expansions are delivered. Players will be able to use them as their in-game avatars once we deploy the Unreal Engine 5 R2.2 release later this year and use them to crew their own spaceships, all while training them and collecting gear, RPG style, through our mobile app, which is also coming in the 2024 updates.

As we progress more in the development, players can expect a fully developed MMO RPG system in which your crew, with their progression systems, skills, and career paths, are central to the game dynamics of the Star Atlas metaverse.

## A Universe of Individuals— Introducing The People Of Galia Expanse

![](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/0752c5fde4a831c937261600a8141dab7a550de8e93ae555ff9adddb6f12f09d.png)

In addition to having aptitudes, names, and abilities, each crew card belongs to a different species of Galia Expanse, which impacts their background stories, which will be implemented in future game updates, producing a unique story for each crew member. See the list of species below and try to form your crew with members that reflect your in-game values and aspirations!

- **Sogmians** — An Honorable species hailing from the Segal Sector, known for their bravery, discipline, and stoic nature. They are recognized as champions of virtue and honor throughout Galia Expanse.
- **Mierese** — A curious species of hunters coming from the living planet Neuno, the Mierese seeks both adventure and secrets while exploring the uncharted territories of Galia. They believe in decentralization, personal autonomy, and self-fulfillment in their quest to save their entrapped God.
- **Punaabs** — The materialistic and carefree sons of Akenat, the small Punaabs live in eternal bickering between their species’ main branches, the Profound and High Punaabs. Nevertheless, those tiny creatures have shown great heart and incredible intellect, allowing them to build incredible enterprises through the stars.
- **Usturs —** A highly spiritualized race of androids with unclear origins and unique conditions, such as the existence of a shared conscience led by a group of their elders and a mysterious reincarnation system. The Usturs unveil the vastness of the void, seeking answers to the secrets within their hybrid bodies.
- **Manus Ultima Divina (MUD)** — The representation of mankind who have left the carcass of planet Earth following God’s calling to a promised destiny amidst the stars. The MUD now seek to rebuild their civilization and prepare themselves for another incursion to find the paradise that they are entitled to.
- **Photoli —** Mighty beings that come from outside Galia. The Photoli are mighty creatures with the power to manipulate the essence of light and are revered as Gods by some lesser civilizations. Their objectives and motives are unknown to other species, making them objects of reverence and fear throughout the galaxy**(Only obtainable through Anomaly tier Crew drops!)**
- **Tufa** — The scourge of the Cataclysm, as they are known in popular folklore, the tufas are little more than a myth nowadays, as the people of Galia have mostly forgotten the Convergence War and the secrets of the rogue planet Iris. Nevertheless, it is said that some special members of the “rocky people” with the ability to communicate wander through the galaxy, hiding their identities and working in secret for unknown plots. True or not, the topic is passionately discussed in every bar of the medium zone.**(Only obtainable through Anomaly tier Crew drops!)**

Now that we understand the crew members well, let’s explore how to acquire them to assemble your fleets!

## Crew Pack Airdrop — Your Ship Crew is Coming!

![](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/d19cc7466d1c8949e1094b4f0f54d21279b7d097dbbbf06cff878d6153837fa8.png)

The first way to acquire crew members is by receiving an airdrop of Singular Crew Packs by owning Star Atlas ships. Depending on how much crew your ship is slotted for, you’ll receive a Crew Pack airdrop matching that one-to-one.

The tier of these individual crew packs depends on the rarity of your ships:

- **Common and Uncommon ships —** Silver singular crew packs
- **Rare and Epic ships —** Gold singular crew packs
- **Legendary and Anomaly ships —** Platinum singular crew packs

Let us understand this better through an example. If Dominic owns a “rare” ship like the Pearce F4, he will receive Gold-tier individual crew packs corresponding to the ship’s crew size. Since the F4 has four crew members (1 pilot, 1 navigator, and 2 security officers), Dominic will end up getting four crew cards airdropped to him.

But fear not! If you don’t have one of the mighty vessels of Star Atlas, you can start collecting your own crew directly by purchasing the standard Crew Packs.

## Prices and Probabilities — The Mathematics Behind Crews and Packs

There are three types of Crew Packs:**Silver**, **Gold**, and**Platinum**. Each pack contains 5 crew cards of varying rarity among the various Star Atlas species. The prices and odds of crew drops associated with each one of the packs are detailed in the following image:
