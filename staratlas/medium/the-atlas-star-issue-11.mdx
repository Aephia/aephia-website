*A tale about building a new world…*

![426 — Now you know // A Metaverse in expansion /// WeAreStarAtlas](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/4603fb3f73012de0dc82b32cd50fb2eba0ecc117e07a75565acaee3e7e75198c.png)

Welcome back, explorers, to another thrilling episode of the Atlas Star!

*This edition is the first one from a new Star Atlas publishing schedule, where you receive a comprehensive development update wrapped in Atlas Star every three weeks, instead of a weekly roadmap report. The following two weeks after each Atlas Star release will be dedicated to connecting with the community via a Town Hall, and a major content piece drop.*

Today we’ll discuss what everyone in the galaxy has been talking about, the 426LIVE event.

From the lovely Akenat system, with their cute and mischievous Punaabs, to the Cataclysm in the inner reaches of the galaxy, one could not help but passionately discuss the many news features the Star Atlas project made available for its community on September 29th.

This grand festival introduced a whole new batch of products. Some of them our community was anxiously awaiting, such as the Showroom. But ATMTA also revealed some unexpected but warmly welcomed additions, such as the SCREAM Fleet Viewer and Showroom distribution through the Epic Games Store!

In this edition, we’ll explore every one of these releases while looking toward the future of Star Atlas.

Nevertheless, our tradition here at the Atlas Star ✧, the official Star Atlas newsletter, wherein all things start and end, is to share with our faithful readers the latest details of our special project, such as the newest roadmap updates, the thriving partnerships, our contests and everything else related to the Star Atlas metaverse.

As one wise Punaab used to say: “Life is too short not to enjoy your favorite beverages.” So get yourself some cold drinks as we start our journey across the Star Atlas galaxy.

Our first stop is one of the fundamental structures of our metaverse, the founding block of our political system: the Star Atlas DAO. Let’s look at how the Star Atlas legal minds are preparing to give form to the most crucial entity in the Star Atlas ecosystem.

## The DAO — The First Star Atlas Metaverse Institution

![Artistic representation of the Star Atlas DAO Chamber /// Triple-A Metaverse Work in Progress /// Immersive Unreal Engine 5 Experience.](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/c0a9230d982d3e3121f13506af7ee54d35a9f25360467b5154c5bbf59b87101e.jpeg)

The 426LIVE event started with an unexpected event. The first presentation was about the Star Atlas DAO, where the head of the Star Atlas legal team, Dan Park, introduced a 30-page document called [ “A Sustainable Governance Framework.”](https://staratlas.com/assets/pdfs/sustainable-governance.pdf) This substantial paper details the vision for one of the key elements of Star Atlas: the decentralized governance of its metaverse.

But first, let’s remember the nature of the DAO, its relationship with other in-game structures, and its overall importance for the Star Atlas Metaverse.

The Star Atlas DAO is the overarching political arena of our metaverse, comprised of three different levels:

1. The Star Atlas DAO — The highest tier of governance within the Star Atlas project. Its attributions vary from monetary policy and treasury management to game development decisions. This is the focus of the article disclosed at the event.
1. The Faction DAO — At the second tier of governance, we will have three faction DAOs, each belonging to one of the three primary factions in the game. The faction DAO is focused on managing its factions’ interests, such as tax policies in the faction territory, warfare coordination, access to endgame content, and development targets.
1. The Regional DAO — The third tier of governance, the regional DAO is responsible for the governance of a region in the Star Atlas metaverse, such as a star system. The land owners of any given star system will be able to vote on decisions, such as taxation and monetary incentives, planetary restrictions of goods and services, and overall local rules.

Now that we understand the three different levels of the DAO, we can explore how the newly released governance document will lead us toward building the Star Atlas DAO.

The document has three main parts:

a) Why decentralization is mission critical and well suited for Star Atlas.

b) The vision and structure of the Star Atlas DAO.

c) A proposed sustainable governance framework for Star Atlas.

For the first topic, we present to our community how decentralization through blockchain technology permits Star Atlas to achieve new heights never before seen in the gaming industry.

For this to happen, we establish three key elements that decentralization must include for Star Atlas to succeed.

The first attribute is permanence. By deploying most of the protocol and governance on chain, the NFT structure confirms the digital property of our members, and immutable smart contracts will govern these metaverse transactions for all time.

The second is economic utility. This is achieved by the possibility of nearly instantaneous interoperability of digital assets. Our players will be able to transfer in-game assets following the underlying game logic from one to another directly or through the marketplace system, allowing them to acquire value.

The third is the critical censorship resistance. The Star Atlas political power will be dispersed through its community in a form that no single actor, even ATMTA, will be able to unilaterally alter, shut down, or cause to fail simply by leaving the ecosystem.

After analyzing the structures of other current existing DAOs, and their overall successes and failures, we felt the most important way to achieve those objectives was through an effective governance framework.

The second topic of the article looks at the vision and structure of the Star Atlas DAO.

We investigate the current Star Atlas decentralized structure by studying how different groups have collaborated to build the Star Atlas ecosystem and how we envision our community potentially becoming the main force behind the improvement of the Star Atlas galaxy.

We also explain that this level of commitment is only possible under an organized structure that protects not only the system against bad actor attacks, but also leverages the ability of builders and developers to expand Star Atlas.

Finally, the third part offers a proposed sustainable governance framework for Star Atlas. We present our ideas of how to create and safeguard such a necessary framework for political activity inside Star Atlas.

The core of this structure is the necessity of a founding document, establishing the core principles of the DAO as an institution. We call this the Star Atlas Constitution. This document is currently being drafted in collaboration with the Star Atlas community, and it will establish the following topics:

- Core Principles**—** describing the most enduring values and fundamental rights of the Star Atlas community
- Supremacy and Jurisdiction — Defining how the DAO exercises ultimate authority with respect to sub-DAOs
- Decision-making Framework — Codifying the DAO’s proposal-making process
- Implementation Framework — Explaining how decisions made by the DAO shall be executed, particularly when a decision cannot be made purely through on-chain commands
- Dispute Resolution Framework — Setting forth a process to resolve disputes among Star Atlas community members
- Amendment Framework — Describing the process required to amend the Constitution.

This constitution will be the core of the Star Atlas political system, allowing it to deal with day-to-day cases pertaining to the processes necessary for the DAO to function, while allowing room for adaptation over time.

The next step after establishing the Star Atlas Constitution is the creation of the Star Atlas Council, an institution consisting of elected representatives from the Star Atlas ecosystem who will shepherd the proposal ideation and drafting process. Every proposal will be analyzed before voting in order to prevent potential legal liabilities and malicious or unintended effects.

The Council will serve as a filter to ensure proposals focus on decisions that best serve the long-term goals of the DAO.

The Star Atlas Council will only guide the voting process, not control it. This is very clear in the next part of the article — the Proposals and Voting Process — where we detail how the different actors, and especially the whole community, participates in the political process of Star Atlas “PIPs” (POLIS improvement Proposals).

Finally, in the last part of the article, we explain how the Star Atlas Foundation works as the legal, real-world entity that will represent the DAO’s will.

The Foundation serves as an agent of the DAO to fulfill the limited purpose of carrying out certain defined activities. It cannot make independent decisions for the DAO, it cannot unilaterally access the DAO’s treasury, and its governing documents provide that it is charged with always serving the best interests of the Star Atlas metaverse.

Moreover, the Foundation is dependent on funding from the DAO’s treasury that must be approved through the PIP process. The Foundation merely carries out the DAO’s orders, particularly when a legal entity is required — e.g., to sign contracts for the DAO.

As you can see, the structure as a whole is thought to be a system of checks and balances that allows the best outcome for the Star Atlas ecosystem. We are already thrilled to see our community members applying to become candidates to the Star Atlas Council in our Discord server and in Twitter posts while we work on drafts of our constitution.

If you found this particular subject interesting, don’t forget to read our article [“A sustainable governance framework.”](https://staratlas.com/assets/pdfs/sustainable-governance.pdf), and get up to speed with Star Atlas politics!

## The Star Atlas Graphic Novel — The Prequel To Our Metaverse

![CORE — The Star Atlas Graphic Novel /// Triple-A Metaverse Work in Progress /// Immersive Unreal Engine 5 Experience.](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/0d9eaf58368b111a0cc18ed97fbad84aa70421681c6dbb6156888a350a3269af.png)

Another highlight of the 426 event was when Tim Mcburnie, one of our lead artists and writers, delivered a very special message about the past of Star Atlas and the essence of our graphic novel, revealing its name: CORE.

In a powerful speech, Tim shared his past as a graphic novel artist and spoke about the foundation of his current work within Star Atlas. In his words, the graphic novel is an epic adventure that tackles the question of finding what is worth fighting and dying for.

The presentation also showed glimpses of the drawings that were created to tell the stories of the unlikely crew formed by the MUD Gyun, the ONI Mierese Moda, and the Ustur Osia. Their luck, or fate, will forever change the future of the Star Atlas metaverse.

As an announcement gift, we prepared a little something for everyone who signs up for the CORE newsletter: a small teaser showing scenes of the first episode of our novel! Make sure you subscribe [here](https://staratlas.com/campaigns/core-graphic-novel) and start learning about the chain of events that took us to the current state of affairs in the Star Atlas metaverse!

## ATLAS Locker — The interconnection between Game, DAO, and Marketplace

![The ATLAS Locking vault /// Triple-A Metaverse Work in Progress /// Immersive Unreal Engine 5 Experience.](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/882e2310f60793be6ecf001fd3886f22f66153f7f6956ec0c6279de8e9e42495.jpeg)

The next announcement of the 426 event came in the field of economics, where our CEO Michael Wagner announced the ATLAS Locking feature.

To better understand this new addition, let us analyze the Star Atlas economy and how it interacts with the ATLAS locker structure.

As we know, the focus of the Star Atlas universe is its game structure, but in order for it to function, players must go through our marketplace as both entry and exit points.

Those interactions happen as our players need to acquire the assets necessary to start their adventures in the metaverse, acquiring the primary assets to play the game, like ships, and again whenever they want to sell anything that they have collected or crafted during their galactic travels.

This way, the marketplace is like the heart of the Star Atlas economy, making ATLAS move by facilitating commerce between our players and enabling the creation of the main supply chains that will be necessary for the galaxy’s overall welfare in the future.

Another vital feature of the economic relationship between the marketplace and the game is the funding of the DAO, which will receive part of all in-game fees whenever there is trade in the market.

The current fee occurs only on the seller side, is established at 6%, and is split between ATMTA, which receives 67% of the emissions, and the DAO, which receives the other 33% of the fees.

We summarize the three main structural connections in the picture below:

![Star Atlas economy architecture /// Triple-A Metaverse Work in Progress /// Immersive Unreal Engine 5 Experience.](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/ffad35dd8365a120bde3344ed83b9546eeeb5179b45a04ecca44ece2edc32837.png)

With the ATLAS locker, players will be able to deposit their ATLAS in order to receive rewards in POLIS, as well as discounts on the fees of the marketplace.

This means that those who save their ATLAS will receive incentives for political participation in the form of POLIS and a further benefit from their trades in the market in the form of fee reductions, ranging from 10% to 85% of the 6% fee charged by the market.

The fee reduction and the amount of ATLAS locking necessary for them are explained in the following chart:

![](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/7f4ab37cc06e2704fb9baa3da6f87973f5336b5f95ba013a37227f0b76f4b12b.png)

It’s a simple process which allows you to lock your tokens by following these steps:

1. Go to [govern.staratlas.com](https://govern.staratlas.com/lockers/atlas) and launch the DAO app
1. Connect a wallet
1. Click on ‘Lockers’ (tab)
1. Under ‘ATLAS LOCKER’ click on ‘Lock Tokens’ (link)
1. Lock amount and lock button (bottom left)
1. Marketplace discount (in the center)
1. Rewards claim (at top)
1. Withdraw button (bottom right corner)

## The F-KIT — Star Atlas Paves The Way For Integration Between Solana and Unreal Engine

![Bridging Web3 and Unreal Engine game building /// Triple-A Metaverse Work in Progress /// Immersive Unreal Engine 5 Experience.](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/1b98b7077ec6f629ac3a45bdd51fa45cdb941d01e703a59bd2613cb2fd02e15d.jpeg)

The next release of the 426 event was aimed at a very special crowd of the Star Atlas ecosystem: our builders! Captained by one of our leading engineers, Jim Carter, ATMTA disclosed one of its long-term projects, the F-KIT!

This new product is essentially in-game software that allows your Solana wallet to instantly connect and participate in gameplay transactions in Unreal Engine 5. As a result, you won’t have to worry about pop-ups all over your screen when entering the high-risk zone, making your performance and overall in-game experience better!

And we didn’t stop there! This new Star Atlas product is free and open source, so any Solana developer can start playing with it today by going [here](https://github.com/staratlasmeta/FoundationKit)!

This is another step we’re taking to forward our decentralization ethos. After coding in the Solana and blockchain ecosystem for more than a year, our engineers realized that we needed to pave the way for new builders. By doing this, we hope to attract many new talents to Star Atlas and the entire Solana game-building community.

We know how hard game design is, and the blockchain component adds another layer of complexity that most game-developing teams cannot tackle right now for a myriad of reasons. For example, the need to:

- Hire or build a full-scale blockchain engineering team
- Bring in third-party contractors or consultants
- Seek an outside development firm

Our F-KIT allows game builders to overcome these difficulties. We envision it saving up to 80% of the development and time costs a company would spend on creating the infrastructure for an Unreal Engine 5-Solana integration.

Check out what our F-KIT offers:

- Allows the in-engine generation and import of Solana private keys and wallets.
- Permits Unreal Engine 5 to interact with on-chain data (reading on-chain data from the game and allowing the game interface to perform on-chain transactions: sNFTs, xNFTs, and tokens).
- Creates an Unreal Engine 5 wallet management feature that allows users to see and interact with all of their SPL tokens and NFTs.
- Embeds development support, including visual coding blueprints for user interfaces and user experience.
- Integrates with any Solana program.

Even though it’s already a handy tool, we are not stopping there! ATMTA aims to continuously add new features to our F-KIT to make the integration smoother and attract even more builders to the Solana ecosystem!

## A Surprise — The SCREAM Hangar Fleet Viewer

![SCREAM fleet viewer /// Triple-A Metaverse Work in Progress /// Immersive Unreal Engine 5 Experience.](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/3a33a34c5207b8549574b115702b49a436f968a063ef29ebc8eca32ee1cdbf4b.png)

After the F-KIT presentation, the whole community expected the Showroom release, but Star Atlas had another surprise waiting in the wings! The 426 event welcomed Mo Yazdani, the lead Project Manager of Project SCREAM, our WebGL browser game, to talk about the latest project developments. He also shared SCREAM’s impressive [hangar viewer](https://hangar.staratlas.com/)!

Players can now see how their fleets will be in the SCREAM protocol by connecting your wallet with the viewer. Just as a quick reminder, SCREAM will be the first strategic gameplay module of Star Atlas, where our community will need to coordinate their actions to expand their factions’ borders and influence across the many star systems of the galaxy.

SCREAM will allow our players to discover exotic star systems in the medium-risk zone, collect different types of resources from various planets, and fight deadly battles in space while defending their factions’ banners.

The hangar viewer is the first time our community gets to dwell in the realm of SCREAM, and members shared many beautiful photos of their fleets on our Discord, like the one below:

![](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/8c42ee62f485544673a6788b7198787c7a649295581536f7c3e747d994f1d530.png)

## The Epic Showroom Release!

![The Showroom /// Triple-A Metaverse Work in Progress /// Immersive Unreal Engine 5 Experience.](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/99b6fd60dc6930fc87b275edffe4d7ac0e1e3de66e6d88c8bdb1cd0b3e25b254.jpeg)

At the previous 426 event, through the gameplay of Danny Floyd, Co-Founder and CPO of ATMTA, the Star Atlas community was able to meet its long desired Showroom, the first place our players can explore inside our project Unreal Engine metaverse!

Although the Showroom release was already planned, ATMTA surprised most of the crypto world by sharing the partnership with the [Epic Games Store](https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/) to distribute and release the Pre-Alpha Showroom game client.

It was also announced that our core community members who have been supporting Star Atlas daily would be the first to visit the Showroom. Only those who had their ships deployed in the SCORE protocol received immediate access to the game codes necessary to download the client.

Once inside the Showroom, the community saw their fleets come to life in the form of beautiful Unreal Engine 5 assets, handcrafted in minute detail thanks to the labor of ATMTA employees and partners.

This first glimpse of the future felt like a rush of 27th-century fresh air for our community members, and they immediately proceeded to explore every secret and easter egg that the shining MUD base, built upon the husk of a dead world, had to offer.

It’s beyond question that this was a massive milestone for our project. Still, we are already looking forward to tomorrow, with the launch of the actual alpha of the Showroom, which will allow multiplayer features, exciting minigame loops, and other secrets that are hidden in the vaults of the Council of Peace.

As Danny said: “Game development resembles the process of a child learning how to move: First comes the hard part, where we have to learn to crawl, and we are here now, crawling. After this phase, the development process gains momentum, and we will reach the stage of walking, and finally, we will have the necessary basis to run, and nothing will be able to stop us.”

Now, it’s time Star Atlas starts walking, with its head high, showing the crypto industry and the whole world what a group of determined dreamers can do.

## The Punaab Whisper — The Atlas Star Tabloid

![One of Exfehors laboratories in the Iris Academy /// Triple-A Metaverse Work in Progress /// Immersive Unreal Engine 5 Experience.](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/2b40f6da26a8e492fb4ee9a0055fae6a89f659bb31a2278604c728ed7f764112.jpeg)

Welcome back to the Punaab Whisper, dear readers!

Today, Libra and I are reviewing one of the galaxy’s classics.

To some, it’s the greatest piece of knowledge in all creation. To others, it’s the ranting of a crazy Punaab. Still, no one can deny that this book: The Most Successful Guide of Common Sense Material for Space Exploration, popularly known as The Guide, is a must-have for anyone who dreams of navigating the cosmic currents of the galaxy.

The book is such a massive repository of wisdom that it makes the knowledge in the Archives seem like a collection of gossip magazines. This gospel of the adventure craft has been translated to every alphabet known in existence and three others that only exist in the theoretical worlds created by the Matemagicians of Ordcam.

Written by professor Exfehors, the guide contains pearls of wisdom for every single situation that space explorers will face in their explorations.

After being saved by the manual’s sage advice, many adventurers have gone so far as to immortalize those lessons on their bodies. Such is the case of Captain Befenka and lesson nº 77, which says:

“Lesson nº 77 — If you run out of fuel in space, remember that most ships are equipped with ways of burning organic matter as fuel for desperate situations!”

Unfortunately for the new MUD crewmember Bud, Captain Befenka didn’t have much food to spare, but his sacrifice and the lesson were tattooed on the ECOS forearm forever.

Many other sayings of this ageless book have become famous across the different star systems, such as:

*“Lesson nº 5 — Most of the universe is formed by some basic underlying natural laws that give us a resemblance of order within the millions of chaotic events that happen within it. Nevertheless, the closer you get to the “Cataclysm” the looser the holds of those laws become. If you want to be successful in your explorations of the inner reaches of the galaxy, be mindful that even gravity or time are not to be trusted there.*

*Lesson nº 10 — Never go through an asteroid belt. It doesn’t matter if this will be a hassle or make you spend more fuel. Simply don’t go through an asteroid field.” — The Most Successful Guide of Common Sense Learnings for the Benefit of Space Exploration.*

*Lesson nº 11 — The path to prosperity is simple, but not easy. All you have to understand is that the economy operates under laws of its own: If you can manage to tame your desires in the short term and produce value to others, Atlas will become your obedient servant. If you can’t, it will become your most terrible master.*

*Lesson nº 83 — Whenever you explore the depths of an unknown world, make sure to bring proper hydration, food, jetpacks, accessories, and night vision or lanterns. Statistics show that 13% of the deaths in the medium-risk zone come from being ill-prepared to deal with the common dangers of the depths. And if you find any monster, make sure to turn back and call the nearest Council of Peace office. Don’t try to engage with them, as they will make the world collapse on your head, literally…”*

Nevertheless, among the many timeless pieces of advice contained in this book, every adventurer holds dearly in their hearts lesson nº 0, as a mark of a proper space professional captain:

“Lesson nº 0 — Don’t go out into space, or maybe even get out of your bed, without your Most Successful Guide of Common Sense Material for Space Exploration at hand.”

We managed to speak briefly with professor Exfehors, who was busy with some experiments in his laboratory at Iris Academy. After a pleasant but dangerous conversation filled with explosions coming from what seemed to be a newly designed weapon, we discovered firsthand that the professor was planning a new edition of his book, reviewing the lessons, and preparing some surprises for his fans.

We are very excited about the perspective and look forward to seeing this new edition!

## Updates

In this second part of the Atlas Star, we will address the latest updates in terms of corporate infrastructure, lore, and overall updates!

### The Latest Star Atlas State of Economy Report

![Quarterly report /// Triple-A Metaverse Work in Progress /// Immersive Unreal Engine 5 Experience.](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/9f42d1a2fb33655131e2f4ff9b4b4fd61d6a5c50d3f0e73d0df7f0ac80341760.png)

On the day following the 426 event, ATMTA published an essential document about its ecosystem’s overall economic state, the Quarterly[ State of Economy Report](https://staratlas.com/newsroom/economic-reports).

This document thoroughly analyses our project economy, aiming to inform community members and spur public discussion regarding the Star Atlas ecosystem.

If you want to see the highlights, here are some of the conclusions reached by their research:

- Aggregate daily ATLAS wages grew by 4.4%
- The average wage per ship declined by -9.5%
- The aggregate employment rate per ship decreased by -0.44%
- The size of the labor force grew by 14.3%
- Ship prices fell by -8.5%
- The market value of ships outstanding increased by 5.9%

The report also discusses different areas of the Star Atlas economy, such as net ATLAS earnings by class of ship and the DAO revenue.

You can also read the report’s summary by checking our medium article [here](https://medium.com/star-atlas/star-atlas-releases-its-latest-triple-a-state-of-the-economy-report-2e28dc21453a).

### The Star Atlas A.I art contest

## Roadmap Lore Reports

![“Rise above your horizon, and become a beacon of hope for the galaxy.” — The inscription at the central gate of the Iris Academy.](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/f7010895613af7388eeb2ca58f61a0d929bc8bbaafa02ea0628556e081477263.png)

On the weekly lore side, the secrets of the frozen planet Gerio are finally revealed! Wenn and the Punaabs find themselves on a quest to save the people of Gerio from its malicious government. But first, they will need to pass through Atoph’s realm… Read the links below to learn more about their stories and the overall affairs of one of the most dangerous areas in the Star Atlas galaxy.

Our lore resumed on episode number eighteen, [The Truth About Gerio — Part III: Star Atlas Roadmap Scan #18](https://medium.com/star-atlas/the-truth-about-gerio-part-iii-star-atlas-roadmap-scan-18-6b25cbcab4ab). When we heard the last of the message from Arfrentos Silver Claw, revealing details about what happened with Fang and Pawn’s parents and Gerio after the Convergence War.

In the next issue, the plot thickens as our hero team decides to venture through the hunting grounds of Atoph. [In Punaabs and The Crimson River: Star Atlas Roadmap Scan #19](https://medium.com/star-atlas/punaabs-and-the-crimson-river-star-atlas-roadmap-scan-19-68e519a709cd), the group starts passing through Atoph’s territory, fighting the harsh elements of the depths of Gerio. Suddenly, the group gets separated, and new challenges endanger the expedition’s members.

In the next chapter, [Atoph’s Lair: Star Atlas Roadmap Scan #20](https://medium.com/star-atlas/atophs-lair-star-atlas-roadmap-scan-20-31d945ccbf6f), Wenn is attacked by a new creature that triggers memories inside a forgotten corner of Yago’s mind. Fang falls into a trap, and Pawn rushes to her brother’s aid. However, things are not looking good for the group as Atoph’s tentacles start to wrap around them…

Finally, in the last released chapter, [The Council of Peace Academy — Mission Showroom: Star Atlas Roadmap Scan #21](https://medium.com/star-atlas/the-council-of-peace-academy-mission-showroom-star-atlas-roadmap-scan-21-36f38988861), the plot moved to a more civilized place of the Galaxy, where Asha, one of the leading captains of the Council of Peace is summoned by the headmaster of the prestigious Iris Academy for a critical mission that could impact the current status quo between the factions.
