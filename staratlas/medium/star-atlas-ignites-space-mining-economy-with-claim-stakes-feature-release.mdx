Using Claim Stakes grants Star Atlas players access to galactic resources. By enlisting the [Claim Stakes from the Galactic Marketplace](http://play.staratlas.com/market/?category=structure&itemClass=stake&utm_medium=medium) in the [Faction Claims on/chain app](http://play.staratlas.com/claims/?utm_medium=medium) at play.staratlas.com.

The Faction Claims app is Solana’s second fully on-chain Star Atlas gameplay feature release. The first and still available application is [Faction Fleet](https://play.staratlas.com/fleet/?utm_medium=medium) where players pledge their ships for factional fleet service and earn ATLAS in return.

Claim Stakes are the foundation of planetary gameplay loops in Star Atlas. They are physical objects that claim planetary plots, grant the owner access to extracting available resources, and build in-planet infrastructure.

Enlisting a Claim Stake in Faction Claims will reward a player with 4 vital resources (R4) for intergalactic journeys: *Food*, *fuel*, *ammunition*, and *toolkits*.

This is just the first use case of many that our space travelers will have. So keepan eye out for SAGE news, where your Claim Stakes will be even more critical to your galactic conquest.
