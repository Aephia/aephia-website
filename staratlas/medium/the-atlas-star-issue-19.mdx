*A tale about building a new world…*

![In the world of politics, a wrong move may have deadly consequences. /// A Metaverse in Light Speed Expansion /// We Are Star Atlas](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/a403a450bc2022454ae15fe7456c6a5fe5bddbea9653c8d6920d1a0bba696516.png)

Captains from all corners of the galaxy, be most welcome to another episode of your faithful Atlas Star, the people’s journal, which is coming in hot for another mindblowing release!

In this edition, we start a brand new topic of investigation.

For now, we will close our economy tomes and turn our eyes towards another exciting pillar of Galia Expanse, the civilized face of power and bastion of our decentralized future. We are talking about **Politics and the Star Atlas DAO**.

Through this edition, we will explore Star Atlas’ latest movement on this fascinating pillar of our metaverse, the**POLIS DAO Decentralized Governance System**, our newest application, which allows players to propose and participate in political proposals for the ecosystem through a comprehensive legislative process.

So, get ready to learn more about the intricacies of this rich environment, and prepare yourself for a career as a *Polistician*!

Aside from agreements and plots, we will also explore many different topics about our universe’s developments!

You will learn everything about a community favorite, the lore wiki, the consolidated knowledge about Galia Expanse, the transition of the Star Atlas economy to a player-driven model, the latest discoveries of the Punaab whisper, our product roadmap update, and much more.

So, fetch some protein bars, sit comfortably, and let’s depart. Or, as the Sogmian explorers of House Exinade like to say: To the Stars!

## The Governance System of Star Atlas

![Politics is the true power /// A Metaverse in Expansion /// We Are Star Atlas](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/52b46115afe63651cee713c70aea171fa8c1fba976054690987e3197a31d7e27.png)

Politics is the art of accommodating distinct desires through negotiation and peaceful means. It’s the bastion of civilization, making the ruling body the servants of the people they represent, not the contrary.

This is the noble mission of those involved in politics, both in the material world and in Galia Expanse. Nevertheless, in both realms, some think differently and want to ascend through the ranks of the political arena for their own benefits and merits.

Which approach are you taking?

Today, you are called to pick sides on the metaverse political battlefield. As we walk you through Galia arena, you will realize this game loop has already begun. The many moving DACS, espionage, betrayals, plots, and deals are already happening, and the **POLIS Improvement Proposal** system (PIP) is just the apparent and formal face of an intense and rich political system.

Fear not, though. The Atlas Star will show you how to navigate those turbulent cosmic currents before you can choose how to express yourself in the Galia Political system. Our first stop is explaining how this system works, and to do that, we must first understand the vehicle of political expression, our token, POLIS.

## POLIS, Politics, and The DAO

![The Cradle political arena never stops /// A Metaverse in Light Speed Expansion /// We Are Star Atlas](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/b6f0089664abeaa4d7251f15e335f85340f1c3df63882f8b613bd603e6aa8a85.png)

To participate in Star Atlas decentralized political world, one must first obtain POLIS. Right now, the only way to do so is through exchanges, but in the future, you will be able to get it through in-game activity.

[Even a single locked token](https://govern.staratlas.com/lockers) allows you to participate and vote in every proposition, but having more tokens, and locking them for longer periods, increases your weight on our metaverse decision-making process, as exemplified in the image below:

![](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/57cbcbba4157ba67de5574338c4130fc5c2b6285d6017feffc22058ba30680ff.png)

The amount of polis, multiplied by your locking period modifier, determines what we call**POLIS Voting Power (PVP)**, and this is the measurement of how much weight you have on the political decisions of Star Atlas.

Once your PVP is set, you are ready to put the political world in motion by proposing and discussing**POLIS Improvement Proposals (PIP).** The PIP’s are the absolute authority in terms of legislative power in Star Atlas. Whenever one of them is approved, our whole metaverse changes with it, and there is no limitation of subject or content that the DAO, the collective representation of the citizens of Galia Expanse and owners of PVP, can’t decide on.

But how does this system work? Well, glad you asked because our upcoming release is all about providing the infrastructure for that!

The governance application establishes the legislative infrastructure necessary for the DAO to work in terms of procedure and legal backbones, ranging from how Proposals must harness support from the community to be put to the vote, the role of the members of the DAO Council and the quorum necessary to approve any PIPs.

Since this is a substantial proposition for our political system, we have established an entire roadmap to allow the community to participate, provide comments, and even make changes before it’s actually put to the vote.

It’s going to work in a four-step process:

- **Declaration —** The content of PIP-1 is disclosed, and the community can assess the initial groundwork proposal on the many different aspects of the Star Atlas Constitution, the Star Atlas Foundation (which serves the DAO), and the processes for on-chain decisions, establishing full transparency and decentralization.
- **Deliberation —** It’s the phase where the community discusses the articles and proposals of PIP-1. We will have public debate sessions and discussion-specific environments, both on the DAO Forum and on Discord, which allows the community members to thoroughly engage with every aspect of the proposal and comment on each one of the insertions of the text.
- **Decision —** Once the community analysis is thoroughly done and there isn’t any doubt about the many aspects of the PIP, we will move to on-chain voting. This is the moment where your**POLIS Voting Power** will come into play, and you will be pitching your PVP on what you believe is best for the future of Galia Expanse. Vote wisely!
- **Democratic Convergence —** Should PIP-1 be approved, we will then proceed to hold the Star Atlas Foundation Council Members elections and start the citizen’s proposals system, inaugurating the age of the DAO rule over Star Atlas Political Ecosystem.

You can check the summary of this roadmap in the image below.

In the next Atlas Star, we will walk you through the details of the Star Atlas DAO Political system, explaining the legislative process for Citizens Proposals, the functions of the DAO Council, and how this political activity impacts the future of the Star Atlas game.

Keep your eyes and ears open. The politics of Galia are going on in full throttle, so make sure to keep up and start strategizing with your DAC members on how to navigate the cosmic currents of the DAO!

## The Beginning of a Player-Driven Economy

![A Power Plant generates the so-needed energy for your Claim Stakes /// A Metaverse in Light Speed Expansion /// We Are Star Atlas](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/546258b70d846d512951e2e944326c47b856e560f849f5be48ef63daf7b92774.png)

An exhilarating revolution has taken place in the Star Atlas universe! Our economy has received a turbocharge, firmly placing control of the universe’s resources in our player’s hands. We ramped up the output of ammo, food, fuel, and toolkits (R4 resources) from Claim Stakes and Escape Velocity, propelling us into a thrilling new era of a fully player-operated economy.

In this new age for the citizens of Galia, Claim Stakes have emerged as the linchpin. Depending on their Tier, these machines have yielded a treasure trove of R4 resources, powering us toward a player-shaped economic system. We also launched half of the remaining Claim Stakes onto the Galactic Marketplace at an awe-inspiring 20% discount. Couple this with the high-octane activity in SAGE: Escape Velocity. This cutting-edge spectacle spurred on resource loot drops, and we have an intergalactic economic balance that keeps the market forces in a dynamic equilibrium.

This new scenario is an essential preparation for the next step of Star Atlas gameplay, which will be inaugurated by our new SAGE gameplay loop, which will allow our players to extract resources from celestial bodies and craft their resources and many more items inside the Star Atlas metaverse.

This monumental milestone marks our epic journey to a fully player-controlled economy. Now, more than ever, the future of Star Atlas is in your hands!

## The Star Atlas Lore Wiki: Learn The Secrets of Galia Expanse

![Paizul Busan Memorial Tomb /// A Metaverse in Light Speed Expansion /// We Are Star Atlas](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/bda41839c3a08d4fc5f3794afd1d6b4dd740997996245b62c22ac8762b07c3ad.png)

It’s no mystery to anyone in the Star Atlas community that lore is the core of our project.

Starting at the very first Star Atlas product, our Rebirth Posters Campaign, when the world first learned about MUD’s, ONI’s and Usturs to Never Alone, where players can participate in adventures through Galia, lore has been driving Star Atlas products and movement since our inception.

This effort of our writer’s team created over 150.000 words of lore content in less than two years, words that described races, planets, religions, plants, events, ships, and hundreds of different characters and stories.

Now, all this content is unified in a single place, the[**Lore Wiki](https://lore.staratlas.com/), and it’s already ready for our lore-loving captain’s exploration.

There, you will find monthly updated entries with every piece of lore ever produced by Star Atlas, keeping you updated with the tales of our glorious heroes and nefarious villains. Navigating Galia’s cosmic currents has never been easier, so make sure to check it out and follow the monthly updates!

## The Punaab Whisper — The Atlas Star Tabloid

![A Galaxy at War /// The Armstrong IMP TAP /// We Are Star Atlas](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/2eca1a383f526949aa4dd975261addddeb972462ec2c21b2ac7bbc1aa4ad658e.png)

The conflict in the middle zone escalates, Dear Readers!

The whole galaxy has been watching in awe the sudden movement of the Council of Peace in the medium zone, which broke over a hundred years of non-interventionist policies from the strongest entity of Galia Expanse.

After the initial invasion, which nearly wiped the Jorvik and ECOS from the outer rim of the medium zone, the troops, under orders of Vaor Scarka have been advancing to more tactical operations in the inner parts of our galaxy while facing strong resistance from the rogue factions and their planetary forces.

More recently, in a clear display of the escalation of tensions, the planets’ leaders allied with the ECOS and Jorvik halted the trading of common resources with the Council of Peace forces, closing one of the main sources of food, ammo, toolkits, and fuel that the Council had access to.

This initiated a movement among the entrepreneurs and Captains of the Council welfare, who now have been forced to generate those resources by themselves or acquire them from private parties, no longer being able to buy them from the Council since they are now holding their assets to keep the troops in the frontlines.

This surprising change of scenario shows that this conflict is far from over, with the medium zone planets willing to challenge the Council of Peace might, even if by just denying trading.

Rumors have it that other faction leaders are not as happy as Vaor with this attack on the medium zone, and even within the ONI Consortium, there are mixed feelings about Vaor’s decision.

One thing is certain. There will be blood in the medium zone.

This is still a developing story, and your humble reporter and his assistant Libra.Iddt will persist in their quest to bring all the news directly from the middle zone!

Until the next edition!
