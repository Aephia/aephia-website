*The quarterly paper of record offers economic insight into the world’s fastest growing ecosystem of the gaming metaverse*

![The Golden Age of Space Exploration /// Insight Into Star Atlas Metaverse Economic Boom /// Immersive Unreal Engine 5 Experience](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/5d6e05935cf5bcf6e3044e6e00a90c0e3de031f4b122a060414dbfc02fc70851.jpeg)

The Department of Economics at ATMTA, Inc., the developer of Star Atlas, has unveiled its flagship [report titled *State of the Economy](https://staratlas.com/newsroom/economic-reports/star-atlas-economic-report-2022-q2)*, presenting a comprehensive set of tools and data for a birds-eye view of the Star Atlas economy.

The report brings a series of firsts, including the first Census of the Star Atlas Universe, and the introduction of the *labor force* as a key concept in metaverse econometrics. The research also points to Star Atlas contributing roughly 1% to total global crypto adoption in December 2021.

> “We’re building a decentralized worldwide digital country with a virtual economy for people to participate in,” commented Michael Wagner, Co-Founder of Star Atlas and CEO of ATMTA, Inc., its development studio. “In this first of many reports, the economics team has done tremendous work in showing the transformative potential of the industry for the global population,” he added.

The current economic paper analyzes the behaviors of participants in the Star Atlas ecosystem to date, featuring a deep dive into[ Faction Fleet](https://play.staratlas.com/fleet), the first gameplay module also known as Ship Commissions On Remote Expeditions (SCORE),[ released on December 17, 2021](https://medium.com/star-atlas/faction-fleet-service-gameplay-star-atlas-8e18421d01d9).

The analysis finds SCORE to be resilient in the face of the wider market’s high volatility, providing the Star Atlas community with a firm base for metaverse exploration, resulting in the growth of player fleets, diversifying into a variety of classes, and utilizing[ ATLAS](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/star-atlas/) earnings to purchase additional ships.

The supply of new labor hours came from fleet deposits of XX-small ships, which commanded low ATLAS wages per ship. Adding these ships into the capital stock lowered the average daily earnings per employed ship from around 22 ATLAS to 16.8 ATLAS.

### Key Report Highlights:

- The growth in the labor force drove aggregate daily ATLAS wages to increase by 18% since the beginning of 2022.
- The size of the labor force grew 49.1%.
- The average wage per ship declined -27.1%.
- The aggregate employment rate per ship decreased 3.7%.
