> “*My only desire… freedom, my only loyalty… the crew, my only property… the universe.” — A Jorvik raiding song*

### Mission Log — as told by Shadow Ops, Agent M4

“It was a cloudless night in Liblit. The sky was a canvas full of colors from the rich planets and the moons that occupied the heavens this close to the center of the galaxy.

Here, criminals worked under the cover of darkness.

As one of the stations in the so-called high-risk zone, Liblit was well known as a place of thievery, illegal deeds, and every other activity that would constitute a crime under the Council of Peace regulations.

If you were watching the movements in the streets that particular night, a young human, no more than 26 Earth years old, might have caught your eye. He made secretive glances as he passed the dark alleys, traversing into a decaying building that mimicked the style of the MUD pre-voyage era.

There, the silhouette of an old Punaab, of above average size for his species, awaited him. Gray whiskers, a scar across his right eye, and a conniving wide grin left no room for doubt that this was Mr. Sbugolz *— *the very same character who was rumored to be an original member of the Freedom Smile, the ship captained by the Jorvik leader. The bounty on his head was 50 million [ATLAS](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/star-atlas/). Yeah… not the biggest fish in the sea, but hey, he was a fish nonetheless.”

At this point, the Agent was interrupted by a very thin and angry voice that started to shout in the background: “NOT THE BIGGEST FISH?!” shouted a tied up Punaab. “You damned Mierese scum! I will have your Bahle come out through your mouth!”

“Wow,” interjected the Mierese. “Language! Didn’t your mama teach you better than to interrupt your captor’s glorious mission report?”

“Glorious mission report, *KIKIKI*?” said the Punaab, wheezing through his whiskers and laughing. “What are you, a freaking kid? Tell you what, you can report all about my bahl… Humpf!!!”

The Mierese packed the Punaab’s mouth with the dirtiest piece of cloth he could find. “As much as I’d like to hear about your fixation with private parts, please wait a bit until I finish this, ok?” said the Mierese official.

“Hrmm!!!! Hmmmpf!!!”, cried the muffled Punaab.

“Oh, blessed silence. Now where was I? Oh right, so there he was, a seemingly nervous human just before the mighty Mr. Sbugolz, flanked by two not very friendly-faced ustur androids. Better now?”

“Hmmm! Hmmph! Hmmmmm!!” The Punaab tried to answer.

The agent of the Consortium was pretty sure it was another reference to the private bits. He shrugged and returned to his report.

“The Punaab started the meeting by saying: “Well, well. Look what the cosmic currents brought to our shores, lads, *kikiki*!” While laughing profusely, Sbugolz looked at his henchmen.

“Our very own spy! Leaking the juicy secrets of ATMTA Industries to our noble freedom cause, *kiki*! What a good little human! Isn’t that right, lads?”

“That’s right, boss, affirmative!” said Henchman 1.

“The very best boy, boss!” said Henchman 2.

“*KIKIKI*, that’s right!” said the Punaab, sliding into a feeling of ecstasy. “The information you gave us last time was indeed very good! We managed to advance our agenda through the whole galaxy. The big boss was really pleased!”

“Mostly pleased, boss!” said Henchman 1.

“Very appeased, boss!” said Henchman 2.

“But it was not enough,” said the furry pirate, suddenly changing the happy mood in the room. “We need more, Lieutenant Wenn! Tell us what you uncovered! My whiskers get all curly at the sound of a good old data robbing!”

Wenn started: “Milord, beginning with [The Marketplace](http://play.staratlas.com/market), they are about to end the prototyping phase. From what I could gather, regarding the Blockchain front, their ATLAS staking program design is progressing well. They also moved to assist their front-end engineers in prototyping the core user flow, which is going full steam right now.”

“For their Upcoming Activities, on that front, once the staking design is approved, they will start implementing it, while preparing a strategy for the users to test the prototype.”

“*KIKIKI*, I LOVE THIS!” the Punaab shouted with glee. “Sweet ATLAS stakes to plunder, lads!”

“This is a blessing, boss!” said Henchman 1.

“A gift from the Makers, boss!” said Henchman 2.

“But please, good lieutenant, do proceed. What else do you have for us?” asked the entertained villain.

“Well, regarding the **SCREAM** Project, the team is still working on finishing the explicit requirements for the core gameplay mechanics. They have also started prototyping a new program for**Blockchain architecture** while they refine it with the gameplay requirements. In terms of the**economic developments**, they have onboarded the Director of Economy of ATMTA, who will work directly on the modeling of the gameplay economic loops. Finally, I uncovered that they are adding more functionality to**WebGL** prototypes and that they have also onboarded an additional front-end WebGL developer to project.” replied Wenn.

“Intriguing… I suppose they will be working on those mechanics for the next week as well. Right, Wenn?” asked the pirate while scratching his chin.

“You are correct, Milord.” answered the Lieutenant.

“Very well then, move on.” replied the Jorvik, his tiny hand resting alongside his anxious face.

“After that, I also found some new information regarding the**Showroom**”, said Wenn, restarting his report. “As I mentioned before, it’s well advanced, and they are working on some interesting details…” said the Lieutenant with a pause, allowing the anxiety to build in the room.

“Spill it out, Human!” said the Punaab while jumping over the table. He brought the small dagger just a few inches from Wenn’s face.

Wenn smiled and said: “Milord, in my last report I told you they had completed the Game Design and the Concept Art, so now they are building the basics of the gameplay mechanics. We might see the save/load feature complete any day now. Also, the User Interface models are in good progress. Once their basic visuals are approved they will start the work on the terminal systems, integrating those into the game and testing with the pipeline. I actually managed to acquire this picture from their database.”

![Modular Cliff System Built and Alpha Set Pieces Placed /// High-fidelity Fjord Design /// Cinematic Quality Unreal Engine 5 Experience](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/6fb6f199b533b16a055566aa7551033602160979edbf19fa15e44906e3c314f2.png)

He added: “Also, they have managed to sync ATMTA blockchain architecture with the wallet technology, resuming the wireframe production work on the Blockchain front.”

“*KIKIKI*! This is sending chills down my old bones! Can you feel this, lads?!” asked the Punaab, still poking his dagger.

“Absolutely resolutely, Boss!” said Henchman 1.

“In every screw of my body, Boss!” said Henchman 2.

Lieutenant Wenn kept going: “This is not the end, Milord. The **DAO** also had a productive sprint. They are on the last steps of prototyping! The Proxy CPI is nearing completion, and the DAO team is working together with the ATLAS staking personnel. They are incessantly working on the wireframes necessary to work out data features inside the DAO architecture and typescript bindings to communicate with Solana Programs. Finally, they are following the progress of the Goki/Tribeca audits.”

Wenn stopped to catch his breath, looking every one of the pirates in the room in the eye before continuing:

“Finally, the**system polishing** work also had improvements. They managed to further update the Terms of Services and Privacy Policy format, while also working on optimizing the mobile user’s profiles. Another very neat feature is that they added endpoints to Galaxy users to enable 3rd parties to access the total circulating token supplies of ATLAS and POLIS in real-time.”

The eyes of the Punaab shined green with greed in the dark room. After a small pause, he said: “This is enough, Lieutenant Wenn! *KIKIKI*! The boss will be even more pleased! I’ve got to say, Wenn, you proved your value once more. It’s time that you got your recognition!”

The Punaab made a small gesture and Henchman 2 went to the back of the room, barely taking a minute before coming back with a big cube stamped with the Jorvik symbol.

Before a confused Lieutenant Wenn could react, Henchman 1’s thick arms clamped down on him. As Wenn tried to disengage, the Punaab placed the box around one of his arms and said:

“Welcome aboard, Brodah!! *KIKIKI*!”

“The cube sprang to life after feeling the touch of the Punaab, biting the arm of the Lieutenant as a hungry beast.” Agent M4 narrated in an epic tone, before pausing and saying:

“Lieutenant Wenn, in honor of our friendship, I will leave out the high-pitched scream that you let out, ok?” said the Mierese, with a perfectly blank face, even though he still had the communicator button pressed.

The tired human murmured an answer, not paying attention to the dramatics of his Mierese companion. Wenn’s gaze was focused on analyzing their long-sought objective: The “tattoo” on his forearm that identified him as a legitimate member of Jorvik.

If only he had more time… maybe they could crack the technology and replicate it… but it wasn’t any good to dwell on imaginary scenarios, not right now when there was so much at stake and so little time to act. Wenn strained to focus his mind and started the walk toward the ship.

“Let’s go. We have a flight to catch. Please continue your little play inside the ship. We aren’t out of hot water just yet,” said Lieutenant Wenn to the Mierese.

The Mierese grabbed the Punaab as gently as he would grab a bag of potatoes, which caused more groans from the angry captive. The Mierese didn’t seem to notice and continued his story as he entered the ship, signaling for two guards to drag the knocked-out usturs.

“After a few seconds, the cube entered into the human arm, molding itself as a tattoo of the Jorvik Pirates.” said the agent, resuming his log.

“Before the ugly pirate could utter more of his lousy *kikiki* laughter, a very handsome Mierese appeared from the corner shadows. Everything progressed quickly after that”- the Mierese spoke to the communicator in his arm.

“Two flashes of teal light broke the darkness in the room, and the Usturs were down in an instant. The Punaab grew pale, as the first lights of the twin moons of Liblit, coming from a crack on the wall, gently kissed the beautiful silhouette of the famous bounty hunter that stood before him.”

“Everything was over in the blink of an eye. Mr. Sbugolz and his henchmen were arrested. We got the cube inside. Lieutenant Wenn and our crew are ready to roll on the real mission.”

End of Mission Log — Shadow Ops Agent M4

At this point, Lieutenant Wenn, who had been listening to the Mierese give his report, was profoundly inclined to write a report of his own. Hell, he thought to himself, he should report that the Mierese agent was living in his own reality, seeming to “forget” what Wenn deemed important details, such as the agent’s weapon jamming, the Punaab madly laughing *KIKIKI* with his custom laser Gatling gun and the whole chaos that followed.

He even opened his mouth to protest as he watched the Mierese inject a drug into the Punaab, who eventually stopped resisting. Ultimately, Wenn decided it wasn’t worth it.

“Yago has a few too many screws loose. It would be weird if he didn’t, though… considering his past.” thought Wenn to himself and shrugged.

The Mierese sat in the chair next to the Lieutenant. They fastened their seat belts as their ship, an elegantly customized [Thrill of Life](https://play.staratlas.com/market/67UPc3C4RStjBn1pZUiyvHsaG6XQ5GgKnu9ec4WCQgQm) from the Busan manufacturer, started powering up for the jump to space. The Mierese opened a bottle of a bubbly drink and raised his legs to the edge of the ship’s console.

“Here we go, buddy” he said, giving the drink to Wenn, before popping an intoxicating beverage for himself. “No drinking and driving”, he said solemnly.

“It’s gonna be a loooong journey…” murmured Lieutenant Wenn.
