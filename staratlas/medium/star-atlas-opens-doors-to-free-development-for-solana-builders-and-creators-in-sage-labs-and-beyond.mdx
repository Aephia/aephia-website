Starting with the SAGE Labs browser game, technology entrepreneurs, blockchain developers and enthusiasts on Solana and other blockchains now have new possibilities provided by Star Atlas developer tools, featuring bindings and dedicated documentation at [Build.staratlas.com](https://build.staratlas.com/?utm_medium=medium&utm_campaign=G23B).

The dev toolset provides insights into the cutting-edge blockchain gaming mechanics and strategies being employed in the Star Atlas ecosystem. The IDLs, bindings, documentation and SDK featured in the tools set a standard for blockchain gaming mechanics, setting a new bar and serving as a standard for blockchain games. The set offers developers a toolkit to create, modify, or expand upon the existing game mechanics, encouraging community-driven enhancements.

Builders can use open-platform Star Atlas developer tools to securely build a live economy, linked to real life, a unique possibility in the blockchain industry. The toolset also makes it possible to play the whole game via an Application Programming Interface (API), enabling anyone to build their own entire front end and functionality for the game.

With blockchain gaming continuing to gain traction, the developer tools offer priceless technological insight and position individuals, developers, and companies at the forefront of this emerging industry, opening doors for collaboration and innovation.

SAGE Labs offers players a unique experience by integrating crypto elements like tokenized asset management with traditional gaming mechanics like resource extraction, crafting, and fleet management. Open-platforming provides transparency into the game’s mechanics, algorithms, and strategies, fostering trust among players and stakeholders.

With SAGE Labs, Star Atlas is not only blurring but fully eliminating the lines between crypto, DeFi and gaming, between blockchain technology and real-time gameplay, and economic systems and immersive experiences.

Star Atlas Developer Tools provide a deep dive into the game’s mechanics and foster a collaborative and transparent environment for the broader web3 gaming community.

The release is accessible to all blockchain communities including Solana, where participants can benefit from understanding and integrating this functionality, and showcases technological capabilities to users of other chains, such as Ethereum with its Layer 2 solutions like Avalanche and ImmutableX.

This open-platforming initiative enables building on top of SAGE Labs. With this early access feature, Star Atlas is transforming the gaming space with a fourth dimension, showcasing the first true fusion of crypto and gaming where users capture and retain their own value over time.

SAGE Labs open-sourcing initiative provides a comprehensive solution for decentralized gaming, offering players an engaging, fair, and transparent gaming experience while empowering developers with tools to innovate and expand upon the game’s universe.

SAGE Labs offers a technically advanced, blockchain-based gaming platform that combines real-time gameplay with strategic depth, all while promoting transparency and community involvement through its open-source initiative.

## **Made for builders**

With the open-platforming package, developers building applications on Solana can now leverage Star Atlas Player Profile and other functionalities in their projects and tech entrepreneurs can develop or expand their decentralized applications and platforms. Tech-savvy individuals can also learn and contribute to open-source blockchain projects.

Star Atlas has been committed to open-platform decentralized development since inception. With the release of the [open-source F-KIT SDK](https://github.com/staratlasmeta/FoundationKit) for bridging Unreal Engine 5 to Solana in 2022, the open architecture of its products including the [Galactic Marketplace](https://play.staratlas.com/market/?utm_medium=medium&utm_campaign=G23B), Escape Velocity, [Faction Claims](https://play.staratlas.com/claims/?utm_medium=medium&utm_campaign=G23B) and the [DAO](https://govern.staratlas.com/?utm_medium=medium&utm_campaign=G23B), developers can build third party applications on top of every feature.

## **SAGE Labs Under the Hood**

As an early access Star Atlas implementation, SAGE Labs is an innovative blend of blockchain technology and gaming.

The gameplay program layer is how the game works and where its value lives. SAGE Labs is a proof of concept of a fully on-chain game that the industry didn’t imagine being possible.

Unlike purely on-chain games like Star Atlas with SAGE Labs, hybrid games representing the rest of the web3 gaming market face major complexity, security and liability issues.

By targeting both crypto natives and traditional gamers, it aims to bridge the gap between these two communities, offering a fresh gaming experience while also introducing gamers to the world of blockchain and cryptocurrency.

Seamlessly integrating crypto functionalities such as token management into the very fabric of gaming mechanics like resource extraction, crafting, and fleet management, it redefines gaming, eliminating the line between finance and play, fusing crypto and gaming into one unified experience.

The main development features of SAGE Labs include:

- **Blockchain Integration** by utilizing the Solana blockchain to record and verify in-game transactions, ensuring security and transparency.
- **Unique Real-Time Mining Algorithm** that the game employs for asteroid mining, simulating real-time and real-life resource extraction.
- **Fleet Dynamics Engine** is an advanced engine that manages fleet formations, movements, and strategies, offering players a realistic space fleet experience.
- **Starbase Management System** is a comprehensive system that handles all starbase operations, from docking protocols to cargo management and crafting procedures.
- **Profile Creation and Management** including character progression.
- **Asset Crafting** system that includes refining and combining acquired assets.
- **Coordinate and Movement System** that is fully localized.
- **Inventory Management Systems** that are entirely localized.
- **Logistics** via sophisticated fleet composition metrics.

## **Highlights of Open-platform Benefits**

- **Community-Driven Development**: The IDLs, bindings, documentation and SDK enable developers from the community to build upon the game, fostering a collaborative development environment and encourages community feedback and improvements, ensuring the game evolves with player needs and preferences.
- **Innovative Blockchain Integration**: SAGE Labs seamlessly integrates blockchain technology with gaming, offering real-time, decentralized gameplay that’s a first of its kind in the Solana ecosystem.
- **Dynamic Resource Management**: The game introduces a real-time resource extraction mechanism, where players can mine asteroids, introducing a dynamic economy within the game.
- **Advanced Fleet Dynamics**: Players have the ability to create, manage, and disband fleets, offering a level of strategic depth rarely seen in blockchain games.
- **Comprehensive Starbase Operations**: The starbase functionalities are vast, allowing players to dock, manage cargo, and craft items, making starbases central hubs of activity.
- **Open-Source Transparency**: By open-sourcing the game mechanics, SAGE Labs is setting a new standard in transparency, allowing players and developers to understand and potentially modify the game’s mechanics.

This release package is just the continuation of our commitment to an open worldwide ecosystem. In the future, releases of IDLs and bindings, such as those for combat, will accompany product launches.
