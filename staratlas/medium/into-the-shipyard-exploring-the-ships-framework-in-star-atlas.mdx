*The time to receive your ship’s airdrop is near, and alongside its crew members, your vessel will also receive a special Ship Parts Bundle in homage to your early support of Star Atlas! Learn everything you need to know about how they will pave the way for the new vessels framework in our metaverse below.*

## The Path Forward — Ships Built With Components and Operated by Crew Members

As explained in our [previous article](https://medium.com/star-atlas/crew-packs-and-star-atlas-airdrops-are-coming-in-august-important-dates-utility-in-sage-labs-a261baa7a3b6), on August 8th, ATMTA will take a snapshot of players’ current ship holdings, which will entitle them to Crew Packs and Ship Parts Bundles based on the number and type of vessels they possess at the snapshot time.

In this article, we will elaborate further on the Ship Parts Bundles, explaining the direct impacts of their airdrop in the current stage of our game development and how, in the future, they will be the key to kickstarting the ship configuration paradigm, allowing players to customize their ship parts with their own crafted items.

If you are also interested in Crew Packs and how to participate in the airdrop, please read through the detailed walkthrough [here](https://medium.com/star-atlas/a-new-release-on-the-horizon-star-atlas-crew-packs-coming-in-q2-2024-e2603415bc65).

Without further ado, let’s understand how the Ship Parts Bundles will lead to the new ship paradigm.

## Captain on Deck- Understanding The Ship Parts Bundles and The Impacts on Ships After Their Airdrop

The Ship Parts Bundles are a free airdrop bonus for all players holding Star Atlas ships during the snapshot on August 8th. Every ship a player owns will provide that specific vessel’s SFT Ship Parts Bundle. This bundle will come with higher-tier weapons and higher-tier ship parts that will be convertible to the individual underlying components after we deploy the full Ship Configuration protocol. However, the SFT bundles will be tradable in the galactic marketplace immediately following the airdrop.

You can check the different tiers of the components of each type of bundle below:

No other ships will be entitled to the Ship Parts Bundle airdrop after the snapshot date.

The most important aspect of this event is that, after the snapshot, all ships traded in the marketplace will become ship hulls. Ship Hulls are the standard Star Atlas assets, and by acquiring one, they will, by default, come with the following items:

- **Tier 0 core components —** The fundamental components necessary for a ship to function: power core, shield generators, hull reinforcement, warp drive, sub-engine, main thrusters, heat sinks, scanner array, and tractor beams.
- **Utility rigs** — Utility rigs are non-swappable or upgradeable parts of a ship linked to that ship’s purpose. They are the default as part of the vessel specialization, so the ships that need them have them before and after the airdrop. For example, a mining ship, like the Armstrong IMP, will always have its mining rig; no purchase or action is required. You cannot trade utility rigs on the marketplace as they will be part of the ship hulls.
- **Interior elements** — Another non-swappable or upgradable segment of vessels, interior elements constitute the core elements of the ship hull interior, such as the crew quarters, command deck, etc. As such, they are also not affected by the airdrop in any manner.

Nevertheless, it is**crucial to notice** that, after the airdrop, those hulls do**NOT** come with:

- **Weapons** — Any offensive-oriented ship parts, such as Laser beams, missile bays, and turret hardpoints, used for ship combat.
- **Modules** — Extra parts that are swappable but not upgradeable provide different benefits for the ship, allowing further customization of the vessel. Examples of those include cargo modules, fuel modules, and ammo modules.
- **Crew** — The personnel necessary to maintain and execute the ship’s functions during space expeditions. Learn more about crew members [here](https://medium.com/star-atlas/a-new-release-on-the-horizon-star-atlas-crew-packs-coming-in-q2-2024-e2603415bc65). After the airdrop, you must acquire crew members to manage your vessels and use them on SAGE.

The hull prices for all Galactic Asset Offering (initial sale) ships currently on the market and those coming in the future**will follow our ship pricing model and have the same price as current ships**.

As previously stated, all the airdropped ship components and crew are early adopter bonuses. We are not making any adjustments to reduce the prices following the drop, nor are we offering ships in the future, including the bundles, at a higher price. Also note that ATMTA will not be selling any component bundles or underlying components, as those items will be earned through gameplay or player crafting in the future.

For the time being, ship stats, as seen in SAGE/Fleet Command, will reflect your ship as if it has everything equipped in the SFT bundle, regardless of bundle ownership.

Nevertheless, as we will now explain*,*they will impact your ship performance** once our ship configuration protocol comes online.**

## Pimp My Vessel — The Ship Configuration Framework

![](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/8c295d6562b2932f9c74749790ce7d702a450cab935ddf445ccf66fc32f953ab.png)

Currently, every single vessel of the same model in Star Atlas shares the same in-game stats. For example, all Busan Maiden Hearts, one of our capital fighter ships, have the same warp distance, consume the same amount of fuel, and have the same cargo capacity.

This means that all Star Atlas ships are currently semi-fungible tokens. Nevertheless, this will not be the case in the future. The Ship Parts Bundles airdrop paves the way for a new and exciting ship standard, the Ship Configuration Protocol.

Once implemented, Ship Configuration will transform Star Atlas vessels into NFTs by allowing players to customize and upgrade their vessel parts to match their game strategy.

In this new paradigm, six different assets impact the ship functions and overall performance, some of which are swappable or upgradeable. To make it easy for our captains, we have broken down how they will work in the picture below:

![](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/d5d1679520b16bcc3b46b9cad79491768c0391ee1c64b9f92d32aaffbdfaf141.png)

Once the protocol goes live, you can open your bundles and equip your upgraded components, weapons, and modules. Your ship’s stats will then reflect the type and tiers of the parts you equip on your ship.

Remember that Tier 0 core components are not tradeable since you cannot remove them from a ship. You simply overwrite them when you equip a higher-tier item over them. If you remove a component, the tier 0 reappears, so the slot is never empty.

Another exciting aspect of this new update is creating new markets for players’ industries.

Weapons, core components, and modules are all swappable items that impact a ship’s performance. Besides the airdrop, the only way to acquire those ship parts is through in-game crafting loops, causing Galia Expanse supply chains to adapt and absorb the demand for them.

Moreover, core components and weapons are also upgradable, forming another industry focused on helping players aim for peak performance on their expeditions throughout the galaxy.

Nevertheless, the impact of Ship Configurations extends far beyond the economic loops of Star Atlas.

The variety of shipbuilding strategies will also impact military-oriented game loops such as ship space battles, starbase sieges, and claim stakes raids. The same applies to any other activity that relies on ship performance, such as racing or exploration.

Ship Configurations open the doors for an entirely new layer of immersion in our gaming ecosystem. Now, through the airdrop of the Ship Parts Bundles, we walk toward the gates of this new Star Atlas paradigm.
