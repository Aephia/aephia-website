[UPDATED] Star Atlas fans should stay vigilant and beware of Internet scams preying on them by always verifying the source and validity of the message.

![Pearce R8 Refueling-Repairing Ship WIP /// Player-Owned In-game Asset /// Immersive Intergalactic Metaverse](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/fde39eb3062440addbc6469fbc13dd0b1d8d2199bc22247fcef8633041a76824.jpeg)

Over the past week, our community has been receiving an increasing amount of reports about fraudsters trying to take advantage of their enthusiasm for the intergalactic metaverse.

Upon investigation, we have discovered a series of fraudulent look-alike websites, fake social media accounts, malicious cloned Telegram groups, bots and individuals offering false token sales, setting up phishing traps for unsuspecting users and other nefarious activities.

If you receive any of the below, please disengage the source immediately, report it to the platform if possible, and know that Star Atlas will never attempt to do any of the following.

## **Types of Fraudulent Messages & Scams that are not from Star Atlas**

### ❌ Last-Minute Token Sale, Token Pre-sale or Token Private Sale

Star Atlas will**never** offer you a pre-sale or a private sale of tokens, nor will you ever be offered a time-limited token sale displayed on fraudulent websites and talked about in false social media group on Telegram.

### ❌ Token or NFT Giveaway

Star Atlas does not offer conditional giveaways of tokens or NFTs that would require collecting your personal information or transferring your funds in advance.

### ❌ Telegram Groups, Channels and Discord Servers

Star Atlas has**one** official Telegram group*,*one** Telegram announcements channel, and many non-English speaking Telegram communities.**

Phishing operations have created fake channels with a lot of followers using official Star Atlas logotype and fake usernames that look like those of real team members. Do not be deceived, always check whether the social media property is official by cross-referencing it on [StarAtlas.com](http://staratlas.com).

Exercise caution on the community-led non-official Star Atlas channels, including the non-English communities, and be vigilant about receiving any monetary opportunities or offers. When in doubt, reach out to the official [Star Atlas community on Discord](http://discord.gg/staratlas) for help.

Be particularly cautious if your Telegram setting for *automatically accepting invites to join groups/channels* is turned on as scammers will invite you into a false group that imitates a real one, and attempt to defraud you. The Telegram group auto-join setting is on by default, we recommend **turning it off immediately** for your own safety by going to *Settings > Groups and Channels > Who can add me to group chats*.

### ❌ Fake ATLAS or POLIS Token

The ATLAS and POLIS tokens originate only on the Solana blockchain. Scammers create tokens with the same ticker/name elsewhere and try to offer them or sell them. Please remain vigilant and always verify their origin — correct contract address — on CoinMarketCap ([ATLAS](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/star-atlas/) and [POLIS](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/star-atlas-polis/)).

### ❌ Fake Websites, Marketplaces and Assets

Fraudsters are creating fake Star Atlas look-alike websites, marketplaces and NFT assets. Be careful of the links you receive do not interact with and do not connect your wallet to any site before you verify its authenticity. Furthermore, always make sure that the NFT in question is truly originating from Star Atlas.

### ❌ Fake Google Ads and Other Advertisments

Fraudsters are also targeting unsuspecting searchers on Google and internet users in general with fake, copycat Google Ads that pretend to be coming from Star Atlas, leading you to fake websites and attempting to defraud you there. Exercise caution both before and after clicking any link or banner, and closely examine its spelling and correctness.

## **How to recognize real Star Atlas sources:**

### ✔️ Official VS Copycat Website URL / Domain

Star Atlas maintains a single website, [StarAtlas.com](http://StarAtlas.com) (spelled S T A R A T L A S . C O M) and a Galactic Marketplace at [Play.StarAtlas.com](http://Play.StarAtlas.com) . Pay attention to the URL of the website and make sure that it is spelt correctly as fraudsters take advantage of hard-to-spot misspellings.

There are multiple fraudulent websites whose domain name looks similar to StarAtlas.com, so take extra care when clicking links or typing it into your browser address line.

### ✔️ Official VS Copycat Website Content

Star Atlas has a new, immersive, easily distinguished website that separates it from copycats. Phishing websites are usually using the old Star Atlas website look and fake token countdown counters with which they try defrauding you. Always type in StarAtlas.com to double-check that you are on the real website.

### ✔️ Official VS Fraudulent Telegram/ Discord Activity

Always make sure that the social media property you are on is official by cross-referencing it in the website footer on [StarAtlas.com](http://staratlas.com). The following are the official links to real Star Atlas social media channels:

**Official Telegram Group:** [https://t.me/staratlasgame](https://t.me/staratlasgame)

**Official Telegram Announcements Channel:** [https://t.me/staratlasgames](https://t.me/staratlasgames)

**Official Discord Server:** [https://discord.gg/staratlas](https://discord.gg/staratlas)

Any other channel on Telegram or Discord claiming to be an ‘official source’ for Star Atlas is fraudulent.

We hope that these tips will help our community stay out of harm’s way. Always make sure to do your due diligence in verifying that what you are seeing is truly coming from Star Atlas, and report the fraud to the appropriate online authority whenever possible.

And please don’t forget the guiding Internet principle: If something sounds too good to be true, it probably is.
