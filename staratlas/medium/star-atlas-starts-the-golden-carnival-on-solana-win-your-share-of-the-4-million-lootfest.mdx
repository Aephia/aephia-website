Here’s a simple breakdown of how to get involved and bring home your slice of the $4,000,000 pie:

1. Craft Golden Tickets in Star Atlas: Golden Era**OR** get them directly from players on the [Galactic Marketplace](https://play.staratlas.com/market/GT24XW4QvPxm1Dj63kYQMVa2nwwReLtcWXyHzA6G4yRw/).

2. Submit your tickets into a weekly loot drop on**Hedgehog (Opens early next week)**

3. Join our [Discord ](https://discord.com/invite/staratlas)every Friday at 10AM PT / 1PM ET to see if you win!

This gives players options in how they experience the carnival. If you’re more of a ‘supply the shovels during the gold rush’ type, you can craft Golden Tickets in SAGE Labs and supply them to other players.

The in-game recipe is straightforward. All you’re going to need is:

**• Titanium:** 230 units required

**• Toolkits:** 137 units required

**• Framework:** 103 units required

**• Electronics:** 82 units required

**• Power Source:** 69 units required

**• Electromagnet:** 51 units required

**• Field Stabilizer:** 34 units required

**• Radiation Absorber:** 26 units required

**• Particle Accelerator:** 21 units required

And done! All you have to do is set your crew to work on crafting the tickets. Or, if you’d rather just simply join the loot drop, you can get your tickets from players who’ve put in the hard work to craft them. For more details on getting involved, keep reading!

## The 16-Week Loot Roadmap

Each week, you’ll face a new challenge —**which loot drop to participate in** and**how many tickets to commit during a particular loot drop**. Players have full visibility on how many tickets have already been submitted for each week’s loot drop, meaning you’ll have the chance to adjust your strategy up to**five minutes before each one**.

The**Wandering Caravan**, true to its unpredictable nature, has organized 16 weeks of drops:

- **12 Regular Weeks**, each featuring a manufacturer sponsor offering $200,000 in prizes. If you have a preferred manufacturer aesthetic or utility style, choose a set of ships that match your tastes.
- **3 Mega Weeks**, where the stakes rise significantly, offering**$400,000** in potential loot, doubling a regular week’s loot pool.
- **Mystery Week**, the unpredictable grand finale, where you’ll have to trust the cosmic currents for the ultimate reward.

At the heart of the Golden Carnival are**Golden Tickets**. Each week, you’ll have a chance to carefully consider when and where to deploy your Golden Tickets to maximize your chances of winning. In essence, the Golden Carnival itself is a**minigame of strategy**, enabling you to test your wits, planning, and timing. There are 2 ways to get your own Golden Tickets:

- **Craft them in-game**: Players with even modest fleets can work hard to craft tickets in [based.staratlas.com](http://based.staratlas.com), a browser-based testbed for our evolving economy. Use your resources wisely and churn out tickets to increase your chances in the loot drops, or sell them to other players through our Galactic Marketplace.
- **Simply get them on the marketplace from other players**: If crafting isn’t your thing, you can easily head to our [galactic marketplace](https://play.staratlas.com/market/GT24XW4QvPxm1Dj63kYQMVa2nwwReLtcWXyHzA6G4yRw/) to get Golden Tickets from other players who put in the hard work to craft them.
