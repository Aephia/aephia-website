Building the largest space MMO crypto game has forced us at Star Atlas to solve challenges few teams encounter. Out of that journey came Star Frame, a framework born from necessity. Today, we’re open-sourcing it to give every Solana developer the tools to overcome the technical limitations that hold back complex program development.

Solana has supported us from the very beginning, and Star Atlas wouldn’t be what it is today without that foundation. Open-sourcing Star Frame is our way of giving back so other developers on Solana can go further, faster.

## What is Star Frame?

Star Frame is a new framework for writing complex, secure, scalable Solana programs.

Star Frame was built to overcome the technical hurdles that have historically made complex Solana programs difficult to develop. Its flexible, trait-based architecture, dynamic account support, and AccountSet lifecycle give developers the tools to build sophisticated, secure applications more confidently, unlocking new possibilities across the Solana ecosystem.

## Star Frame’s Importance

Star Frame is a modular, trait-based framework that gives Solana developers unmatched flexibility, performance, and safety for building complex programs. By leveraging Rust’s trait system, it provides a customizable toolbox of components that can be adapted to any use case. This architecture enables developers to push past existing limitations while fully harnessing Solana’s high-performance runtime.

## Star Frame Design Principles

Star Frame is built on three core principles:

1. **Modularity:** A trait-based design with practical default implementations gives developers the freedom to plug in or reimplement components, making it flexible enough for a wide range of use cases.
1.**Performance:** Near-zero-cost abstractions and zero-copy data structures keep compute overhead low, ensuring developers can dedicate more resources to their own business logic.
1.**Safety:** Compile-time validation reduces runtime errors, enhancing security for mission-critical logic and tightening the development loop, allowing for faster iteration and program development.

## Key Components of Star Frame

1.**Unsized Type System:** Dynamic, zero-copy data structures like resizable lists, maps, and sets let developers build applications that run with near raw-memory efficiency. In practice, this means everything from massive player inventories in games to complex order books in DeFi can be handled with minimal overhead and cost.
1.**Account Set Lifecycle**: A built-in three-stage process (Decode, Validate, Cleanup) takes the guesswork out of account validation. It ensures security, correctness, and reliability by handling the critical details that are often overlooked, giving developers confidence that their programs are secure by design.
1.**Trait-based Abstraction:** At its core, Star Frame provides a flexible toolbox of reusable behaviors. Developers can use the defaults or extend them to fit unique needs, enabling faster innovation without sacrificing safety or performance.

## Star Frame Benchmarks

Anchor Bench

[https://github.com/solana-foundation/anchor/tree/master/tests/bench](https://github.com/solana-foundation/anchor/tree/master/tests/bench)

We reimplemented Anchor’s bench program in Star Frame (bench.so) and ran benchmarks to see how it performs. Anchor has paved the way for Solana development, and our results show how Star Frame builds on that foundation, providing additional flexibility and efficiency for complex programs.

**ABOUT STAR ATLAS**

Star Atlas is an immersive, high-fidelity, world-building space adventure and grand strategy MMO built in Unreal Engine 5 and sustained by a real, galactic marketplace and economy.

Built as a fully decentralized universe leveraging state-of-the-art blockchain using the Solana protocol, Star Atlas allows players to own and define their story and experience, while interacting in a live, dynamic, community-focused and controlled economy. Empowering a sustainable ecosystem is about allowing true asset ownership, marketability, co-creation, and driving true utility in the Star Atlas universe.

In Star Atlas, you explore space and distant planets, build powerful fleets and assemble crew to navigate, mine, craft, even conquer, while participating in a global, borderless digital economy — ultimately putting the power fully in the hands of the people.
