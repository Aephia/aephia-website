The latest update to Star Atlas’ SAGE Labs, titled **Dawn of The Freighter**, brings two transformative mechanics to the forefront:**Local Marketplaces** and**Faction Infrastructure Contracts**. These features are set to redefine how players interact with in-game economies and mechanics, opening up a wealth of new opportunities and expanding the gameplay experience.

## Local Marketplaces: Trade Where You Play

Local Marketplaces introduce an entirely new layer of commerce to Star Atlas. With this update, each starbase in the Galia Expanse is now an insulated, independent market. Players can**buy and sell items directly at a given starbase** without the need to take assets out of the game for trading. This means that every starbase becomes a localized economy, and the prices of goods will vary depending on the supply and demand at that particular location.

The introduction of Local Marketplaces opens up exciting new career paths for players, such as**freighting**, where players can transport goods from one starbase to another to capitalize on price differences. Additionally, players can transport their**crew** through Galia and use them to craft jobs in order to seize the opportunity for manufactured goods across the various space stations of Galia. The dynamics of trading, transporting, and strategizing have never been more engaging.

## Faction Infrastructure Contracts: Investing in the Future

The new**Faction Infrastructure Contracts** are an evolution of the RFR mechanics, offering players a new strategic way to participate in the Star Atlas economy with predictable earning mechanics.

Unlike the LP system (whose emissions are now 4.5M daily ATLAS to accommodate the Infrastructure Contract emissions), where players would receive ATLAS for their proportional contribution towards the faction objectives during a given epoch, players can now**craft Factions Infrastructure Contracts at starbases** and redeem them for a**fixed amount of ATLAS (2)**. The catch? Contracts can only be redeemed at specific starbases and during designated time windows.

There are three different species of contracts, one for each faction, and they will be redeemable in three different starbases at a given time, rotating amongst a selection of six key starbases in each faction territory:

- **MUD Faction:** MUD-2, MUD-5, MRZ-7, MRZ-8, MRZ-9, MRZ-12
- **ONI Faction:** ONI-2, ONI-3, MRZ-36, MRZ-26, MRZ-31, MRZ-30
- **USTUR Faction:** UST-2, UST-5, MRZ-17, MRZ-28, MRZ-32, MRZ-33

All starbases in each faction will allow you to craft the Infrastructure Contracts, providing another reason for players to explore and extract resources across the galaxy. Timing and strategic movement will be crucial for maximizing the value of those contracts, pushing players to engage deeply with their faction’s infrastructure and economic landscape.

So get ready to craft! Every faction has a different Infrastructure Contract, so make sure to find the materials for your faction recipe! Check out each faction contract recipe below:

**Frameworks**: 234 units

**Energy Substrate:** 78 units

With**Dawn of the Freighter**, every starbase is becoming its own economic ecosystem, creating new dynamics of supply, demand, and player interaction. The introduction of Local Marketplaces and Infrastructure Contracts adds a whole new level of depth to the Star Atlas universe, encouraging players to explore, trade, and invest as they develop the galaxy’s infrastructure.

Now is the time to become a pivotal force in shaping the future of the Galia Expanse. Explore, connect, and**build the galaxy’s future** in this new Star Atlas Golden Era patch!
