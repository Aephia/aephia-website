*Two brand new Unreal Engine 5 in-game ships coming to the Galactic Marketplace are increasing the vast variety of available space vessels*

After the grand overture to the 2022 spaceship manufacturing season with the iconic [Fimbul Airbike](https://play.staratlas.com/market/5xdJFqr5Au4kgGpfoQz9u1fpHhTWoHi4smRB1xxMM4CN), two entirely new ships are coming to the Galactic Marketplace: [Ogrika Mik](https://play.staratlas.com/market/D67jgoRefKgFHNxwyFma4uBFANL6LgbT5Ye5oZHFYMzH) and [Fimbul ECOS Unibomba,](https://play.staratlas.com/market/3obvzbhuUWfBWKU4hxsCZKuTqm7tQXToRCTxtL2uyppY) dropping on Thursday, February 24, at 9 am and 10 am respectively.

After being offered a choice of five enigmatic ships to choose from as the next to drop, the Star Atlas [community picked](https://twitter.com/staratlas/status/1494169210393534466) the [Ogrika Mik](https://play.staratlas.com/market/D67jgoRefKgFHNxwyFma4uBFANL6LgbT5Ye5oZHFYMzH), a small fighter, and the [Fimbul ECOS Unibomba](https://play.staratlas.com/market/3obvzbhuUWfBWKU4hxsCZKuTqm7tQXToRCTxtL2uyppY), an XX-small bomber. The ships were chosen through two massive simultaneous community polls on Twitter and Discord, giving the community members the ability to determine the next drop by a majority vote.

As with the previous waves of the Galactic Asset Offering, the [Galactic Marketplace](https://play.staratlas.com/market) pages of the new ships feature a countdown to sale kickoff time, photo galleries and detailed in-game specs, including Crew, Components and Modules.

For individual Star Atlas players and guilds (Decentralized Autonomous Corporations) interested in forming larger fleets using these ships, there is a [bulk purchasing option](https://staratlas.com/form) available.

Players will be able to immediately enroll these novel ships in the [Faction Fleet](https://play.staratlas.com/fleet) game feature and send them off to deep space missions to earn the in-game currency ATLAS. These NFTs will also be usable in upcoming gameplay modules, including in subsequent iterations of the cinematic quality Unreal Engine 5 Showroom. For more information on these features, check out the [official Star Atlas Roadmap](https://staratlas.notion.site/staratlas/72cb710bbd894cd8819bde948e42ac31?v=5c5cca97579e4cd79089362bf03e55b1).

The availability of each new spaceship’s supply will be in a 80/20 ratio of ATLAS and UDSC. A vast majority of the total ship quantity -80%- is set for purchase exclusively with [ATLAS](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/star-atlas/) and the remaining 20% with USDC, and will continue to trade simultaneously in both currency markets.
