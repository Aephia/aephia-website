*Memories of planet Gerio — Lieutenant Wenn’s dangerous adventures in the depths of the High-Risk Zone*

![The treasures of the deeps, flying in the form of goods to the factions across the stars /// Metaverse in Light Speed Expansion /// Immersive Blockchain-Powered UE5 Experience](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/095a11b7d659be491bda744bab92f6d71ee7b7cb53c056a1a5264abfe61e6dfc.png)

*“Our race is an ancient one and has reached as far as light itself. Yet, some places are beyond our reach. There, true darkness lives.” A translation of the journal of Ahr kept at the Manus Ultimus Divinum secret archives.*

The first thing Wenn did was to stabilize his breath.

His training kicked in, taking him out of the momentary paralysis that the unnameable cry caused by the creature the punaabs called Atoph.

He inhaled the cold air slowly, counting the seconds. Three seconds in, one and a half seconds out. Fully in… Let it go. The automation of the exercise sent a wave of calmness across his body, clearing his thoughts and setting his mind into planning mode.

The wind raged, and Wenn felt each blow of it against his damaged body. Nevertheless, adrenaline rushed through his muscles, even more than during the asteroid field engagement, as if the creature’s howl had awakened some primal instinct of survival in him.

He finally remembered the thermal function of his suit, and as he turned it on, instantaneous relief followed with the warm waves flowing across his body.

He started assessing the situation, even though his field was quite limited due to the snowstorm. Their ship seems to have crashed in the middle of two colossal blue ice walls, leaving a crater on their landing spot, with no way of retreating.

Yago seemed to be alright, or at least much better than a survivor of a ship crash on a frozen planet. The two punaabs also seemed to be experienced and ready for combat. The fact that they didn’t break in fear at this situation said more than a thousand words about their worth.

“Get ready! It’s coming!” The bigger punaab suddenly shouted, not looking at them. The crescent snowstorm partially muffled his voice.

For a brief moment, nothing happened. Wenn could swear that even the raging storm receded as seconds seemed to stretch, and then small black points began to appear in the ancient blue ice walls around them.

Wenn didn’t understand what he was seeing.

A black liquid started to pour through the rigid walls as if they were no longer solid. It was an amalgamation of pure darkness and some sort of jelly that moved in inconceivable ways even for a living being, restructuring itself into tentacles with ends that began turning into horrid, nightmarish mouths.

Instead of attacking, they went still, as if preparing or analyzing the situation. Then they started [calling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioR5np1fmEc). Dozens of foul mouths in unison chanted a call of doom and hopelessness throughout the icy ravine. The sound was so unnatural that Wenn thought he was hallucinating, as he had never imagined that such creatures could exist, even in his wildest dreams.

Yet, there they stood, and as suddenly as they started, they stopped, opening a grim and profane smile, made of fangs of pure black, that was met by a barrage of shots from the bigger punaab. Wenn and Yago quickly followed, shooting the tentacles that started to move in the group’s direction, enclosing them in a circle.

They formed a position using the ship as their rearguard, shielding the boar-like creature whose name was Momo, as the smaller punaabs joined their efforts to repel the attackers. Wenn figured that they would need to use Momo as a mount — like the ancient humans used a horse — to be able to reach out whatever retreat the two punaabs had in mind.

Fortunately, the lasers proved efficient against the creatures. A single shot was enough to subdue the strange beings most of the time. But more of them kept leaking from the wall, and even though they were slow, they threatened to overwhelm the group.

By this point, the potential retreat path would require them to open a way through the growing horde of enemies and up a slight ramp covered with snow. Wenn realized the options were dwindling and it was now or never to make a decision.

At this point, the Mierese holstered his blasters and drew what seemed to be a small dagger linked with a dark chain. Wenn immediately knew what Yago was planning and tried to reach out to hold his friend, but Yago was too quick, and with an agile jump, he was already out of their improvised defenses.

“What is he doing?! He is going to die!” The female punaab shouted, firing her blaster as quick as possible, trying to cover the Mierese that was really close to being bitten by the abominations around them.

Nevertheless, as the first tentacle reached for Yago with his mouth open, it suddenly dropped, undone. A red flare in the form of a blade sprouting through the creature’s head, followed by the whistling song of the weapon powering down and returning to the Mierese hands.

Yago started to move the chain above his head, and the creatures staggered due to the newfound danger as the rest of the group supported the Mierese with cover fire.

Then, Yago’s attack truly started.

The chain revolved around his body like a snake covering the body of its master, and as Yago commanded, it lunged forward, preying on the black creatures that now focused their attention solely on the Mierese.

Each time the knife flew, it took the lives of many enemies as a red flame erupted from the deep darkness of their bodies. Each time it returned, Yago would welcome it with what could only be described as a dance, a succession of very coordinated movements that conducted the chain with speed, weight, and dexterity through his body, only to leave again to claim more victims.

He was once again in a silent flow, the same feeling he had had at the asteroid field as if the world around him disappeared in the presence of the “Hero.” There was only his body, his weapon being an extension of it, and his enemies to be destroyed.

The Mierese kept building momentum as the snow of the ravine became tainted with black ichor. Wenn realized the creatures were not spawning from the walls anymore, and just as everything started, it ended. The beasts were gone, leaving only black water puddles that were now being covered by the snow.

“Yago, you crazy Mierese!!! Damn, I think I will need to let you brag about this forever. Ok, forever is too much, but maybe one month for sure!” Wenn shouted while running towards his friend.

The Mierese turned around, smiling while trying to clean the creature’s black fluid off his clothes, and said: “Well, let’s make it a year, sha-” and midway through the sentence, he dropped to the ground.

As his consciousness started to waver, a thought crossed Yago’s mind: It was the same feeling as in the asteroid field, but this time it wasn’t the ship’s engine giving in, but his whole body. “Man… I wish I could have bragged more to Wenn…” he laughed before his mind fell into a pool of complete darkness.

“YAGO!” Wenn shouted while dropping to his friend’s side and trying to search for a pulse. The two punaabs followed right after, and the girl shouted: “Fang, hurry!! Get the herbs on Momo! He is crossing into the nightmare!!” The girl then tended to the Mierese, removing the black liquid from his body to the best of her abilities.

“At once, Paw.” Fang answered, hurrying to the big animal already moving their way. Wenn checked his friend’s pulse. He could still feel it very slightly. It was clear he needed medical attention immediately.

“Paw, is that your name? Is there anywhere we can treat him? If this thing doesn’t kill him, the cold will! Please, help us.” Wenn pleaded to the punaab, and she immediately replied:

“We have our home not far from here. It’s not much, but it’s better than this. We also have someone who can help nearby. There is no time to waste,” she said while sitting the Mierese and stuffing a bunch of herbs into the mouth of the Mierese along with a yellow liquid provided by Fang.

Wenn remembered there was a first aid kit inside the BTOL and that he could also probably get the artificial intelligence to help them out. He ran back to the ship, where the damaged engines were still smoking.

He felt sorry for his vessel. It was beyond recovery. Despite the principal systems being destroyed, he managed to upload the A.I to his suit computer. This was a significant strain on the suit’s hardware, but there was much that it still could do.

Wenn also found parts of a first aid kit and a couple of explosives, which he hoped he wouldn’t need to use soon. He put everything in a backpack and bid farewell to the ship that served them so well, hurrying to the rest of the group who were preparing to go.

Yago was still out, and the punaabs tried their best to make him comfortable in the saddle of Momo. Fang extended his hand to Wenn, and the group was already trotting their way to the punaabs retreat when a loud crack came from the ice behind them.

When Wenn turned he saw the carcass of his ship being engulfed by a hole in the snow. “What the..” Wenn exclaimed when Paw shouted: “Hurry, Momo! He’s back!”

“Momooooooooo” the guttural voice of the creature replied, going full speed ahead, while a giant black tentacle erupted from the very spot from where their vessel had disappeared beneath the snow.

The creature started the same profane [chant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioR5np1fmEc) that they had heard from the other tentacles, and new creatures began appearing in the snowfield ahead of the group. Now, instead of slowly pouring through the walls, they formed from the ravine’s floor, making it seem as if the snow was boiling and giving birth to the tentacles of Apoth.

Paw directed Momo forward, dodging creatures and keeping his mount on a course toward what seemed to be the entrance of a mountain. Even with the support of the thermal properties of his suit, Wenn felt the cold grip of the wind over his body. Nevertheless, he didn’t have time to worry about that, as he and Fang focused on supporting Paw and Momo by blasting the creatures in their path.

They were getting close to the mountain when another crack just behind them announced the reappearance of the giant tentacle. It came rampaging across the field, aiming to destroy the group and the very ground under them.

Wenn didn’t think twice. He knew the only plan he had could end in disaster, but at this point, he figured it was their best chance. Otherwise, the tentacle would thrash them and everything in the area.

He reached for his backpack, guarded as many medications as he could within his suit, and set a timer bomb inside the bag, which he threw backward with every other bit of ammo they had.

After a few seconds, an explosion that could rival a Unibomba nuke met with the rampaging tentacles, sending shockwaves that threw Momo a few meters ahead. The fact that it didn’t stop running was a testament to the skill of Paw and the tenacity of the animal, as the group, without looking back, went into the tunnel.

“Are you crazy, human?! This could have killed us all!” Fang shouted at Wenn, seizing him by his collar as they crossed the dark passage into what seemed a white valley, permeated with buildings that organized themselves in a spiral near an enormous hole at the center.

“We would be already dead if I didn’t do that, Punaab.” Wenn replied, shoving Fang’s hand.

Before the situation could further escalate, Paw shouted: “shut up, you two!” Her ear was close to Yago’s mouth.

“He is not breathing.”
