[Animoca Brands](https://www.animocabrands.com/), a world-class leader in digital entertainment, blockchain, and gamification, has officially joined the [Solana](https://solana.com)-powered Star Atlas metaverse community as a stakeholder.

Through this groundbreaking partnership, Star Atlas and Animoca Brands aim to:

1. Grow the user base of Star Atlas through cross-platform collaboration
1. Complement each other’s strengths in brand and blockchain game development
1. Cross-license intellectual property between Star Atlas and the Animoca Brands portfolio
1. Empower true digital ownership in making in-game items permanent assets in a self-sustainable player-owned economic system.

Star Atlas, which is building a next-gen metaverse experience on the [Solana](https://solana.com/) blockchain, is in a unique position to bring Solana based gaming to the Animoca Brands ecosystem. Solana’s [Wormhole](https://solana.com/wormhole) technology acts as a bridge between the Solana blockchain and Ethereum’s ERC-20 tokens, empowering cross-chain collaboration between two of the most in-demand blockchains for gaming.

> *“The Star Atlas partnership with Animoca Brands will make the final frontier of the human species available to anyone anywhere in the world. It will empower a new generation of players, creators and dreamers to overcome the boundaries of what used to be considered impossible, and enable a sovereign existence with limitless potential in the metaverse economy,” *said Michael Wagner, Star Atlas co-founder and CEO.

With this functionality in place, collaboration between Star Atlas and Animoca Brands has the potential to become fully seamless. For instance, a gamer on an Ethereum-powered Animoca Brands platform could easily transition back and forth between that game and Star Atlas, exponentially expanding the Star Atlas metaverse.

> “*Animoca Brands is one of — if not the biggest — names in the blockchain gaming community. The insight and opportunities that will come out of our relationship with the Animoca Brands team will expand Star Atlas worldwide and beyond. We’re honored to join the reputable ecosystem of Animoca Brands-backed games, and look forward to revolutionizing the interoperable relationship between Ethereum and Solana gamers*,” said Star Atlas co-founder & CRO, Pablo Quiroga.

From a technical perspective, Animoca Brands develops video games on a variety of blockchains, including but not limited to Flow, Polygon, Binance Smart Chain, Harmony, Hedera, and Ethereum. Specifically on Ethereum, games utilize ERC-20 tokens, in addition to NFTs, that implement both ERC-721 and ERC-1155 standards. The main difference between these NFT standards is that ERC-1155 enables upgradeability, so minted NFTs taking the form of a spaceship, for instance, can add rocket boosters at a later date. Altogether, this standards trifecta enables Animoca Brands to make the most of the Ethereum blockchain by connecting smart contract standards (ERC-20) with NFT standards (ERC-721 and ERC-1155) to provide a holistic blockchain gaming experience.

In the coming months, Star Atlas plans to integrate NFT collections into Animoca Brands’ pre-existing marketplace partners, including ones with mainstream ties.

Through its relationship with Animoca Brands — and made possible through the power of Solana and [Serum ](https://projectserum.com/)— Star Atlas can extend the utility of current in-game features including Ethereum-based NFTs and Ethereum-based smart contracts to Star Atlas. As Solana can process up to 65,000 transactions per second with 400ms block times, this high-frequency performance sets the stage for a Star Atlas metaverse that can expand effortlessly into the future with intellectual property that can seamlessly span blockchain and gaming platforms.

> Yat Siu, the co-founder and chairman of Animoca Brands, commented: “*The team at Star Atlas is leading the charge in the economic and creative development of the metaverse and the future of virtual worlds. Here at Animoca Brands we recognize the potential of the technologies and narratives built into Star Atlas, and we look forward to working together to shape the future global economy of blockchain-based gaming.*”
