Today, Star Atlas, the cutting-edge gaming metaverse with an Unreal Engine 5 pre-alpha game on the Epic Games Store, announced its on-ramp partnership with MoonPay, a leading global crypto payments infrastructure provider. The new worldwide financial bridge to over 160 countries will help onboard millions of players worldwide, simply and easily, and provide a seamless way for everyday people to buy and sell in-game assets, including spaceships and currency. The new feature is publicly available in the Star Atlas Galactic Marketplace at [Play.StarAtlas.com](http://play.staratlas.com/?utm_medium=medium&utm_campaign=G23B).

With state-of-the-art blockchain technology using the Solana protocol, real-time graphics on Unreal Engine 5 and fully on-chain gameplay, Star Atlas offers a unique and immersive gaming experience. The economy established within Star Atlas through player-owned asset ownership blurs the lines between virtual and reality.

MoonPay’s fiat on-ramp provides a smooth experience for converting between fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies, accessible to both those with no blockchain experience and on-chain gaming experts. Using all major payment methods including credit cards, local bank transfers, Apple Pay, Google Pay, and Samsung Pay, it is trusted by 450+ partners. Direct fiat purchases help lower the barriers to entry into the metaverse, making digital assets more accessible than ever.

> Michael Wagner, Co-Founder of Star Atlas and CEO of ATMTA, Inc. said, *“We’re excited to partner with MoonPay to make joining the next-gen gaming metaverse easier. We’ve always seen the future of the metaverse as a public utility accessible to all, and MoonPay is helping us realize this goal. Being able to purchase web3 assets with the highest degree of safety and a wide array of payment options opens the doors of the decentralized metaverse to everyday people around the world and puts them on the path of economic self-sovereignty. The metaverse is now accessible to all, and the possibilities are endless.”*

> Ivan Soto-Wright, CEO and Co-Founder of MoonPay commented, “Our goal at MoonPay has always been to increase cryptocurrency adoption and illustrate the benefit Web3 technology can have in our lives. Our partnership with Star Atlas is a blueprint for the industry to introduce millions to Web3 and move the nearly $200B gaming industry forward.”

MoonPay helps create a safe and community-first metaverse and further establishes Star Atlas as a leader in building a gaming metaverse.
