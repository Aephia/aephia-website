*In a strategic move marked by a cashless transaction, Star Atlas integrates Multichain Ventures, including all intellectual property and the assets of the Project Tokes initiative into the broader Star Atlas Metaverse. This acquisition ushers in the introduction of in-game cultivation mechanics, providing players with the ability to grow exotic plants that, once processed, confer various temporary enhancements to their crew members. This article offers a detailed overview of the merger and its implications for both ecosystems.*

## A Harmonious Integration: Project Tokes Reunites with Its Founding Vision to Enrich the Decentralized Frontier

Tokes stands as the inaugural venture of Multichain Ventures, the pioneering Web 3 entity established by Michael Wagner, CEO and Founder of Star Atlas. Originally designed to streamline the legal cannabis supply chain via advanced Web 3 technologies for both payments and seed-to-sale tracking, Tokes has evolved to align seamlessly with the broader ambitions of the Star Atlas ecosystem. This ecosystem supports the growth and development of numerous projects under its expansive umbrella. Recognizing the potential for greater synergy, Michael Wagner articulated the strategic alignment, noting:

*“Tokes is a project I hold close to my heart to this day. Originally founded in 2016, it was my pioneering venture into web3. As various doors of opportunity closed on Multichain Ventures in 2020, new ones opened with the inception of Star Atlas. It has been my plan since the beginning that we identify a path to converge these two projects in to one. As we build into our fourth year of Star Atlas, I’m thrilled to finally be in a position to make that a reality. This presents a great opportunity for us to not only demonstrate our unwavering commitment to supporters of projects I’ve launched, but to also create a pathway for new user adoption across Star Atlas, and further expansion of our digital economy.”*

In concurrence with stakeholders from ATMTA, Inc. and Multichain Ventures, Inc., cashless incorporation was deemed the optimal approach to leverage these synergies fully. Consequently, ATMTA, the parent company of Star Atlas, will absorb all intellectual properties and assets of Multichain Ventures and Project Tokes. The strategic plan includes the deprecation of the Tokes token through asset conversion into a dedicated set of Star Atlas game assets, and gradual integration into the Star Atlas ecosystem. This transition plan will be outlined to ensure current Tokes holders can seamlessly migrate their assets.

## Asset Bridging and Conversion: Introducing the Cultivation Facilities

The integration process is designed to be straightforward and user-friendly. ATMTA is currently establishing a one-way bridge enabling Tokes token holders to transfer their assets using a one-way bridge from the Waves Blockchain to the Solana blockchain.

The bridge will be accessible via the following [link](https://explorer.tokesplatform.org/) in a couple of hours and will be announced on X/Twitter and Discord once it opens.

In the weeks following the bridging process, holders of the new Solana Tokes token will be eligible to exchange these tokens for Cultivation Facilities, a new asset class within the Star Atlas Metaverse dedicated to the cultivation of exotic plants. These facilities will play a pivotal role in introducing new resources to Star Atlas Metaverse and opening the doors to the**pharmaceutical industry**.

After the introduction of this new asset class, and for six months following, these facilities will be exclusively obtainable via the exchange of Solana Tokes on the Star Atlas Galactic Market. After this period, the acquisition of cultivation facilities will become available for sale in both ATLAS and USDC on the Star Atlas Galactic Marketplace, aligning with the purchase modalities for all other in-game assets. All Tokes redeemed in this process will be permanently burned.

The table below shows the exchange rate between Tokes tokens(TKS) and the different tiers of Cultivation Facilities:

## Cultivation Facilities, New Resources and Crafts, The Underworld of Galia, and Final Notes

The Cultivation Facilities represent a fundamental component of Star Atlas’s newly established crafting sector — the**pharmaceutical industry**. Integrated initially through Faction Claims, these facilities will enable the cultivation of plants utilized to produce various substances, including stims, medicines, and psychotropics. These substances will have diverse effects on crew member performance, both beneficial and detrimental.

From the outset, these facilities will also function as claimstakes for passive resource generation within the [Faction Claims](https://play.staratlas.com/claims/) section of the Star Atlas website, producing vital resources such as carbon, biomass, and exotic new plants, which are crucial for various chemical industry crafting recipes.

It is important to note that some cultivated plants are prohibited by the Council of Peace and, as such, cannot be transported within the safe zones of Galia. However, the Black Markets operating in medium and high-risk zones will provide avenues for trade, offering opportunities to gain a reputation with underworld factions through these transactions in future SAGE updates.

For those who operate within the confines of the law, a variety of lawful crafting recipes will also be available, enhancing crew performance and safety across the diverse worlds of Galia.

This integration not only provides final utility for Tokes token holders but also significantly expands the crafting and career opportunities within the Star Atlas metaverse, inviting Tokes community participation and engagement, so secure your cultivation facility today and position yourself at the forefront of the burgeoning chemical industry within the Galia Expanse.
