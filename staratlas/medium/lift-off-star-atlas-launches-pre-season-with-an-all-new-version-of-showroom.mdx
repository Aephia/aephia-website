*The fully revamped Unreal Engine 5 environment of Release V2.0 (R2) adds a multiplayer preview, dogfighting in space and air track racing*

![The Fimbul Packlite in Volant Station /// Triple-A Metaverse Work in Progress /// Immersive Unreal Engine 5 Experience](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/4be66254c787c33b851681ab1ce616b21a4008bf1afa9bc0f2f888cadc6867f0.jpeg)

Attention, Galactic Explorers!

Today, ATMTA, Inc., the lead developer of Star Atlas, announced the release of ‘Pre-Season’ or ‘R2’, a [new and updated version](https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/star-atlas-bead34) of the Volant Station, signifying a massive growth of the MUD complex from a Studio. With it, the shared dream of explorers across the galaxy — in which they get behind the controls and pilot a magnificent spaceship off the tarmac and beyond the clouds to the deep black beauty of space — has arrived!

If you are itching to experience the new R2 version of the Showroom without further delay, head to [Play.staratlas.com](http://play.staratlas.com) and, if needed, click on the bars on the right side.

Download the new Showroom directly from the [Epic Games Store](https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/star-atlas-bead34).

*Skip to the middle of this article to get more info on how to access Showroom, connect a wallet, create a wallet, get a game key, and much more.*

Upon arrival to the new Showroom, you will find that all that can be done in and around Volant Station has been transformed with a long list of upgrades and enhanced functionality. To get a better understanding of all novelties, let’s take a look at some of the key added features.

![The Volant Station’s New Layout /// Triple-A Metaverse Work in Progress /// Immersive Unreal Engine 5 Experience](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/819013e1b899634b6c64fd79c1873d39246fc346adf6fd68edd40b8085ca057a.png)

### **More room, more polish, more fun**

In this new release, the Volant Station grounds have been expanded with more landing pads and additional acres of wild land to be explored. At the same time, existing environments have been further polished and enhanced. Light rigs and material libraries of the interior and exterior have been refactored to improve quality and reach a consistent look for all assets.

This means more immersive spaces that hold surprises and wonder as this critical hub in the Star Atlas metaverse comes into sharper focus.

### **Multiplayer**

Explorers know that every adventure is more fun when you do it with your closest friends. R2 is the first module in Star Atlas to offer live multiplayer functionality with the ability to invite up to seven of your friends to join you simultaneously in the Showroom.

There’s no limit to the activities you can do with one or more friends, whether it’s moving in and around the ships that any of you own, playing Hide & Seek, holding important meetings, climbing to the station roof or simply hanging out and enjoying the beautiful light of magic hour together.

To be clear, multiplayer is launching earlier in its testing development than the other modules debuting in R2. Your experience may not be perfect. In fact, to help expedite the polishing phase, a Bug Bounty program is being set up which will allow the community to help the team identify issues.

### **Characters and skins**

For the past few months, explorers have been experiencing Volant Station through the eyes of its sole inhabitant, Captain Asha. But with the release of R2, the main menu when first entering the Showroom will be replaced with a character selection screen. Explorers will now have the option of 3 additional characters to choose from, in addition to Star Atlas’ favorite pilot.

And that’s not all. When you enter the Showroom, each character can then be outfitted with multiple skins, all of which, for the time being, are freely available non-NFT assets. Ownable NFT skins will become available at a later date. The current combination of characters and skins creates a range of options to fit your mood and desired look.

![Get ready to introduce your friends to your fleet /// Triple-A Metaverse Work in Progress /// Immersive Unreal Engine 5 Experience](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/d4884883508f5c0aa7f500cf5fef27789ed5d76a0d723d29636142aefd25edd3.jpeg)

### **Dogfighting**

The skies around Volant Station are home to two of the highest rated training exercises in this corner of the cosmos. No academic books and no tuition is required. This training is all about live experience in the line of fire.

Few things cause more of a rush of adrenaline than a mano a mano battle in open space with an enemy firing missiles with the goal of ripping your ship to pieces. Welcome to the Dogfighting Arena, the perfect place to hone your skills as a Star Atlas fighter pilot. Here you will face wave after wave of computer-generated enemies, each using different ships and strategies to test your abilities in terms of offensive and defensive maneuvers. There are a wide range of controls that must be learned to avoid the enemy’s assault, not to mention the many obstacles that come when fighting in an asteroid belt.

In future versions of the arena, you will be able to challenge other players, including your friends, to one-on-one duels, or engage in team vs. team battles.

What makes victories in the dogfighting arena all the more satisfying is the addition of a global leaderboard. In this pre-season there will be no doubt who is the best and most lethal pilot in the galaxy. It will be plain for all to see. Monthly winners will even be entitled to rewards. And who knows, a leader from another guild may notice your high score and make an offer you can’t refuse.

![Space racing never looked better /// Triple-A Metaverse Work in Progress /// Immersive Unreal Engine 5 Experience](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/896bb0b0fc98ae7b957475ce6103c661a23d1cfaec09c1aa05971474f34f5424.jpeg)

### **Racing**

The second challenging and thrilling training demo is the aerial racing track. If you’re competitive in nature — and if you’ve found your way to Star Atlas you likely are more than most — you can tempt fate and push your ship as fast as it can go. But be careful! Miss a gate and your chance to top the leaderboard drops considerably.

Speaking of the leaderboard, climbing it can have advantages beyond the obvious glory and potential mention in the sporting section of the Punaab Whisper or Hologram.

Conquering the twists and turns of this track requires strategy, quick reflexes and finesse. Different ships have different flying mechanics and only training will help you develop the deft touch required. Anything less than perfection will put your standing at risk.

### **Ships**

Everyone can summon and interact with a Floyd Liner for free, which includes opening ramps, elevators, and doors, and even fly around the showroom in it. The same is true for those lucky or savvy enough to own a Calico MedTech. All other ships can be accessed by their owners but interiors and exteriors will not be fully rendered.

Also, for the Floyd Liner and Calico MedTech, the full interior is walkable during the flight in multiplayer mode, but please note this is still in an early stage of development.

Owners of fully ready Pearce X4 can also summon and fly around the Showroom environment.

If you are new to To enter the Star Atlas pre-alpha Showroom, take the following steps:

- Head to[ play.staratlas.com](http://play.staratlas.com/)
- Click on the link that will direct you to the Epic Games Launcher
- Download Star Atlas Showroom and open it
- Once you reach the Showroom landing page, you’ll need to connect a wallet (instructions below)
- Go to your player profile page

## How to connect an existing wallet to retrieve owned ships

There are two ways you can import your existing wallet into Showroom: Use an existing wallet by connecting your Ledger hardware wallet or importing your seed phrase or the private key directly.

To connect your Ledger hardware wallet, …

To import your seed phrase or private key directly, ALWAYS make sure you’re doing this the safest way possible (avoid doing this in public places, make sure that if you use copy/paste you clear your clipboard as soon as you’re done).

Once you reach the Showroom landing page, do the following:

- Click on import wallet
- Select if you want to import using your mnemonic phrase (seed) or your private key
- Enter your 12 or 24 words if you chose mnemonic phrase or paste your private key if you chose the latter option
- Name your wallet and protect it with a password. This password is local only and helps you protect your wallet on your machine. If you lose your password, you’ll have to re-import your wallet.

DISCLAIMER: We strongly recommend against importing a hardware wallet seed phrase into a software wallet. Take special care when dealing with any web3 wallets of any sort as transactions are irreversible and maintaining wallet security is paramount.

## How to create a new wallet

An alternative to importing your existing wallet is to create a new one and send your assets to the new wallet.

To create a new wallet directly in Showroom, do the following:

- Click on “Create Wallet”
- Save the series of words that is provided to you in a safe place
- Name your wallet and protect it with a password. This password is local only and helps you protect your wallet on your machine. If you lose your password, you’ll have to import your wallet with the seed phrase that was provided to you in the previous step so it is extremely important you save it in a safe place (otherwise your wallet will be lost with no possible way to retrieve your assets)

## Getting your game key

Not just anyone can walk into the Showroom to get a first glimpse of this marvel of technology.

The first step to gain access is to**redeem your pre-alpha game key and download the Showroom from the Epic Games Store.**

Keep in mind that if you’re in the Epic Games Store and you see the term “beta key”, “product code” or “game code”, that’s the same as a game key — all are synonyms referring to the same 20-digit number.

Players can gain access automatically when they earn their first badge in Faction Fleet at play.staratlas.com. If you don’t have a ship in your wallet, you can still visit the Showroom and view a sample spaceship.

Head [here for instructions on redeeming your pre-alpha game key](https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/redeem) (called “beta key” or “product code” on the Epic Games Store), or simply enter it in your Epic Games Store user account options.

## Security

The wallet software in Showroom has been found to be secure but is still in a pre-alpha test phase and cannot eliminate all risks if your computer’s security is already compromised. Therefore, it is advised to be conservative when importing assets into Showroom, and to use a new or temporary wallet when possible, especially if your main wallet is a hardware device. The Showroom currently does not support Ledger/hardware wallet connections.

## If you’re using your ships in the Faction Fleet

If you are using your ships in the Faction Fleet, you will still be able to see them in the Showroom. There is no need to remove them. However, if you use your main wallet for Faction Fleet (SCORE) and Showroom, you may want to move your ships to a temporary hot wallet.

Assets should be moved back to cold storage or a permanent hot wallet after use until further wallet support in Showroom is developed.

## Computer/hardware requirements for the Showroom

First of all, in order to have a pleasant experience in the Showroom, you’ll need a computer that at a minimum meets these technical specs (along with 20 GB of clear storage):

- CPU: Quad-core intel or AMD, 2.5GHz or faster
- Memory: 8 GB RAM
- Graphics Card: Nvidia 1080, AMD 5700RX or faster

To experience the Showroom in its full glory and high fidelity, we recommend the following:

- CPU: 8 core Intel or AMD, 3.5GHz or faster
- Memory: 32 GB RAM
- Graphics Card: nVidia 2070 or faster

Note: Mac computers are currently not supported in the Unreal Engine 5 environment. You will need to use a PC or other compatible hardware to enter the Showroom.
