Holders of full Tiers of Meta-Posters now have a path to claiming in-game metaverse NFTs, including state-of-the-art intergalactic spaceships and Tigu.

As a genesis moment for next-gen metaverse gaming experiences, Star Atlas offered its community worldwide an opportunity to take part in the inaugural journey with the release of a series of 14 [ReBirth Meta-Poster experiences](https://play.staratlas.com/rebirth) between April 24 and July 24 2021.

The collection blurred the lines between the real and the virtual, the present and the future, and brought mood-altering AR experiences with interstellar collaborations by world’s top talent such as deadmau5, Blond:ish, Jason Silva, The Fabricant and many others.

Collecting Meta-Posters also meant unlocking a treasure chest of exclusive metaverse rewards and perks, obtained by holding [increasingly valuable Meta-Posters](https://play.staratlas.com/rebirth?initialIndex=0) up to the top of a given ReBirth Tier.

After the final ReBirth meta-poster experience, the time has come to drop [bountiful rewards](https://play.staratlas.com/rebirth?initialIndex=1) into wallets of eligible Meta-Poster owners. The drop will happen in two steps.

- The first step will be on **August 25, 2021 at 8 AM PDT (Pacific Time)**, when an official snapshot of all meta-poster holders will take place by capturing the meta-poster contents of their wallet.

Before the snapshot, the meta-posters should be put in wallet and not for sale on the Galactic Marketplace on StarAtlas.com or other DEX marketplaces. Any meta-poster that is in either an “Open order”, “Unclaimed”, or “Unsettled” status in the inventory or on a DEX Marketplace will**not** be captured in the snapshot. All open orders should be closed, all unsettled balances claimed, and the meta-posters should be in a single wallet in advance of the snapshot time.

The second step will follow in two phases:

- To allow ReBirth meta-poster collectors to fully benefit from the token sale, the snapshot will have stored their wallet address to claim benefits in the token sale.
- Second, on**September 2, 2021 (Pacific Time)*,* seven days after the snapshot, the entire inventory of all assets will be dropped into respective wallets of holders based on the snapshot taken on August 25. Holders will receive all the appropriate [rewards in their wallet inventory](https://play.staratlas.com/rebirth?initialIndex=1).**

This time frame gives meta-poster holders enough time to prepare for the snapshot and rewards drop as well as to [benefit from the token sale](https://medium.com/star-atlas/star-atlas-token-sale-details-revealed-857bf7505fdd). For the meta-posters to count towards Tiers for the rewards drop, holders only need to hold them in a single wallet address to receive the snapshot distribution. They do not need to do anything else with their meta-posters in order to receive the drop.

The drop will also include the rewards for the owners of the Legends Series’ [Armstrong Forever meta-poster](https://play.staratlas.com/rebirth/3J73XDv9QUsXJdWKD8J6YFk4XxPNx5hijqjyxdNJqaG9).

Users who have purchased ReBirth Meta-Posters from #1 to #5 on OpenSea are strongly encouraged to consolidate their meta-posters into a single wallet address, contact the [Star Atlas Discord community moderators](http://discord.gg/staratlas) and migrate them to a Solana wallet through the [Wormhole Bridge](https://www.wormholebridge.com/) when it becomes available.

OpenSea holders will need to migrate their meta-posters through the Wormhole to take advantage of their further use.

In case of questions while preparing for the snapshot and drop, visit our [Star Atlas Discord server](https://discord.gg/staratlas) for guidance and walkthrough with our community.

Owners of Meta-Poster Tier collections will remain eligible for surprise NFT drops and treats in the future.
