*After an intense intervention in the Medium Zone by the Council of Peace, the galaxy narrowly dodged the start of an all-out war. The efforts of civilian leaders and dissenting powers inside the Council have managed to quell, for now, the ambitions of Vaor Scarka, the ruling secretary of Galia’s strongest force. After overthrowing the slave lords’ government in Frenir and repealing the bulk of Jorvik forces that had been harassing the safe zone territories, an ice-thin truce was struck between the Council and the independent governments of Galia.*

*Yet, powers inside the Council factions have again tasted the sweet flavor of the resources found in the medium zone. If not by war, they surely plot to extend their influence on those territories, one way or another…*

*In this scenario, the next COPA is set to take stage. Tread lightly, Captain; any careless moves could set the galaxy on the fire of strife once more, and the echoes of divergence can be heard everywhere. Use your influence and diplomacy in this unique event to help Galia heal its old wounds and move forward in an economic model that supports the populations of every planet of the galaxy.*

Star Atlas is excited to announce the commencement of the second edition of the Council of Peace Assembly (COPA), a prestigious event that invites captains and their fleets to participate in a competitive showcase of strategy, vision, and community building within the Galia expanse. This event represents an unparalleled opportunity for player-owned corporations to display their prowess, earn widespread recognition, and vie for exceptional prizes.

## Elevating the Competition: Enhanced Criteria and Broadened Scope

This year, COPA expands its horizons with newly introduced criteria designed to comprehensively assess the contributions of player organizations to the Star Atlas ecosystem. These criteria aim to evaluate the strategic approaches, organizational structures, and overall impact of these entities within the vast realm of Galia.

For those not yet affiliated with an organization, COPA offers a valuable chance to explore various philosophies, structures, and visions of Star Atlas players’ organizations. It serves as an ideal platform for finding a community that resonates with one’s aspirations in the expansive universe of Galia.
