*Player-owned assets such as mining claim stakes, and on-chain gameplay like SAGE: Escape Velocity become a new source for economic prosperity.*

![Claim Stakes, the Cogwheels of Galactic Economy /// Metaverse Economy in Expansion /// Star Atlas Player-Owned Asset](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/071de2ea79055aa3b614061faa9548d875455fa6ee973df69e71bbd7c7bd4436.jpeg)

Star Atlas is placing the use of player-owned assets at the heart of its economy. After [bringing back ATLAS market pairs](https://medium.com/star-atlas/atlas-spaceships-galactic-marketplace-big-discount-169210b9815e) for ships to the Galactic Marketplace, the transition into a real space economy is accelerating with a series of key measures to enable players to adjust and benefit from it.

These measures include the following:

- A very **steep increase in Claim Stake output** of four key resources — ammo, food, fuel and toolkits (R4);
- Increase in**availability of Claim Stakes** by [listing](https://play.staratlas.com/market/?category=structure&itemClass=stake?utm_medium=medium&utm_campaign=s23a) half of remaining supply for primary sales**in the ATLAS market pair** with an additional 20% discount, as was [recently done for ships](https://medium.com/star-atlas/atlas-spaceships-galactic-marketplace-big-discount-169210b9815e);
- A very**steep increase in R4 resource loot drops** from on-chain player activity**in SAGE: Escape Velocity**;
- **Shuttering of sales of R4 resources** in the Galactic Marketplace directly**by the Star Atlas DAO**, with an equivalent of a 30-day supply for all active Faction Fleet (SCORE) ships remaining for sale until depletion;
- **Economic safeguards** with continuous monitoring and balancing the resource availability to ensure players have the time and means to prepare for a fully operational circular economy.

### **Claim Stake R4 Emission Increase:**

Starting with a dramatic boost in R4 resource generation from Claim Stakes depending on their Tier, we are bringing the ecosystem a step closer to a full economic loop with decentralized decision-making. Using claim stakes, players receive R4 resources in the [Faction Claims](https://play.staratlas.com/claims/) app by claiming land for their faction. There are five tiers of Claim Stakes, which generate R4 resources based on how high the tier is, with higher ones supplying many more resources.

### **Claim Stake listing for sale in ATLAS pairs:**

Half of the remaining primary sale supply of Claim Stakes is now available to players in the [Galactic Marketplace](https://play.staratlas.com/market/?category=structure&itemClass=stake?utm_medium=medium&utm_campaign=s23a) in the ATLAS market pair, with an additional discount of 20% of the original price. The other half of listed factory supply stays available in USDC at the regular price.

### **SAGE: Escape Velocity R4 Emission Increase:**

In addition to resource generating assets becoming the key drivers of the galactic economy, player on-chain activity is an equally important way of obtaining resources. By warping and scanning movement in SAGE: Escape Velocity, the amount of R4 resources in discovered loot drops is receiving a sharp, nearly eightfold baseline increase that will help players replenish the in-game resources consumed in the Faction Fleet. Escape Velocity is a technical showcase of Solana-based space movement where players move a ship across a two-dimensional space field to hunt valuable in-game loot including spaceships, posters, and R4 to replenish their fleets.

### **Shuttering of R4 resource sales:**

In ensuring a smooth transition into a real economy, an unlimited quantity of R4 resources will cease being sold by the Star Atlas DAO in the Galactic Marketplace. To enable players to adjust without interruption, an equivalent of a 30-day supply for Faction Fleet ships will stay available for sale until the R4 amount runs out.

The time of transition to a real sustainable player-driven economy is also a period of adjustment to fine-tune the forces of supply and demand. Drastic increases in generated R4 resources are optimized for a balanced economy, and will help players seize opportunities in the emerging gameplay economy.

## **Claim Stakes and the Economy**

Claim stakes are the first new asset to receive direct economic utility in the existing gameplay ecosystem. They will maintain the R4 resource generating functionality throughout this transitional period into the real galactic economy, and will have their intended purpose evolve together with the game.

Claim Stakes are an important asset in Star Atlas. It is possible that you have received claim stakes if you participated in the ReBirth campaign in 2021 or as part of other campaigns in 2022/23. Please [check your inventory](https://play.staratlas.com/inventory/?category=structure?utm_medium=medium&utm_campaign=s23a) directly on Play.StarAtlas.com for any claim stakes in order to be able to put them to use to generate resources in the [Faction Claims](https://play.staratlas.com/claims/) app.

***UPDATE:** Due to very large user purchases, the finite supply of Resources directly from the Star Atlas DAO has been depleted.**
