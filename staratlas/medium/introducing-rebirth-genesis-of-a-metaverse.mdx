Efforts Include:

- Poster sale launch on Star Atlas Marketplace and OpenSea
- Tiered reward system for Atlassian community
- One-of-a-kind NFT collection integrating augmented reality and custom audioscapes

[Star Atas](https://staratlas.com/) is thrilled to announce [ReBirth: Genesis of a Metaverse](https://play.staratlas.com/rebirth), a way for Atlassians to participate in the Star Atlas pre-launch through the sale of 14 open-edition multimedia meta-posters.

This first-of-its-kind poster sale combines ultra high definition digital art, AR and custom audioscapes into unique works of tradable artwork. Once purchased, posters will be minted into resalable NFTs available throughout the Star Atlas metaverse. New editions will be released each Saturday starting on April 24th for 14 consecutive weeks.

During the 14-week sale, Atlassians can purchase meta-posters on a sliding scale via [Star Atlas ](https://play.staratlas.com/rebirth)and OpenSea marketplaces. Each week’s drop adds a new NFT to the ReBirth collection. The pattern will continue until the final weeks during which the two Tier 5 posters will be available for sale.

But there’s a catch. If you want to pick up the 14th poster and complete the full series, you’ll have to prove you’ve acquired all other 13 posters. Why? You’ll have to grab the 14th poster to find out.

> “Part of the allure of Star Atlas is that it’s an ongoing tour into the infinite unknown. We’re creating a world so fully compelling and curious that Atlassians want to dig deeper into the metaverse,” said [Michael Wagner](https://twitter.com/at_mwagner), co-founder and CEO of Star Atlas.

Atlassians will have the chance to own, lease and sell posters as NFTs purchased from each drop. The more posters an Atlassian collects, the more opportunities will open. The incremental drop process repeats each Saturday until July 24th when all open-edition posters will be converted into NFTs available as in-game rewards.

One more thing: Atlassians who purchase a variety or all of the posters will gain the opportunity to unlock a lifetime treasure chest of exclusive metaverse incentives and rewards down the road, but we don’t want to give away too many details just yet. So stay tuned!

> “Each poster, no matter the tier, will provide a unique and immersive AR experience, using sound effects and visuals that instantly transform your living room into the farthest reaches of the universe. The mood-altering effects, paired with audio collaborations from some of Star Atlas’s favorite musicians will provide an experience like no other. Each poster will provide a metaverse-centric transformational experience that is out of this world,” said [Pablo Quiroga](https://twitter.com/pabloiquiroga), co-founder and COO of Star Atlas.

The 14 super high definition meta-posters blur the line between the real and the virtual world, simultaneously bringing utility and rewards to both. This is just a taste of what Atlassians will experience once the metaverse launches.

Welcome aboard. 🚀
