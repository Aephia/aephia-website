## **COPA Intergalactic Competition: Guild Finalists and Event Details Announced**

*Star Atlas publishes details on COPA, reveals a list of 15 guilds that will battle for epic prizes, and shares more information on how anyone will be able to win a legendary Star Atlas gaming PC by iBUYPOWER.*

Attention All Intergalactic Explorers,

Today, ATMTA Inc., in association with the Council of Peace and backed by the unbreakable union of the three factions, announced the names of the 15 guilds that are moving on to the final round of the Council of Peace Assembly (COPA) Pitch Competition. These guilds will be awarded time to present their vision for the future to the assembled audience at the COPA virtual festival on Thursday, June 16. Learn more about COPA [here](https://medium.com/star-atlas/introducing-copa-a-festival-of-guilds-dc57df0f088d).

39 guilds from across the galaxy, representing ONI, USTUR, and MUD factions, submitted presentations, including multiple entries in non-English languages and a range of guild sizes, from organizations with thousands of members to guilds with only a few members and one with a single person.

The official COPA Council of Judges for the initial round consisted of five ATMTA Inc. team members, none of whom have any association with any guild. Each judge independently scored all 39 submissions using a point system. Scores were added together, and the 15 guilds with the highest point totals were chosen to present at COPA.

The judges admitted to having a challenging time scoring due to the number of very high quality submissions. While many presentations were excellent and substantial in scope, those that specifically addressed the previously published COPA judging criteria were awarded the highest scores.

Guilds that did not make the final list should take heart knowing the value of their COPA participation prize: Each non-finalist guild will receive one hour with senior leaders from the Star Atlas Revenue Operations team to discuss how we can partner going forward for the benefit of the guild and the broader Star Atlas ecosystem. The scheduling of these virtual meetings will begin in the next two weeks.

This is also only the first of what we believe will be many COPA events, so more opportunities to make the finals are likely.

Here is the list of finalists in alphabetical order:

1. Aephia Industries
1. The Atlessio Family
1. Brazilian StarAtlas Alliance — BSA
1. COEXIST
1. The Club
1. Cy-Ops: Bounty Hunters
1. Dark Matter
1. DEEP Profits
1. Final Frontier
1. Gargantua Industries
1. Heimdall Industries
1. Interstellar Alliance
1. Quimera
1. Star Atlas Italia (SAI)
1. Vnonymus-Star VYS
