[Star Atlas](https://staratlas.com/), is proud to announce that it has selected [Solana](https://solana.com/) as the protocol to build out its blockchain driven massively-multi player metaverse. Star Atlas is developing a unique gaming experience by combining blockchain mechanics with traditional game mechanics. Solana launched the first ever “web-scale blockchain” in 2019 making it the [only blockchain solution capable](https://medium.com/solana-labs/year-in-review-2020-c3731d1cc8a) of hosting applications with the computational bandwidth akin to the modern internet, presenting the capability to power decentralized versions of Nasdaq, Facebook, Twitter and all other existing blockchains. Star Atlas fully embraces the potential of decentralized self-sovereign ownership of assets permitted through the implementation of blockchain into asset ownership and NFT marketplaces.

> “Star Atlas will provide the most powerful opportunity in human history for players to realize economic benefits through the extraction of in-game virtual earnings into real-world income. This integration optimizes Star Atlas’ long term goals by plugging into Solana’s thriving community, ecosystem, and best in class technology. The overall vision for Star Atlas is not possible on any other blockchain.” *Michael Wagner, CFA, — Star Atlas, Co-founder & CEO*

As blockchain technology continues to evolve towards enhanced capabilities, innovative development possibilities emerge. With the release of Star Atlas, all in-game assets will be delivered to the player as direct-owned non-fungible digital tokens. Gamers will possess complete control of their purchased assets. Selecting Solana was an obvious choice due to its processing capabilities of 50,000+ transactions per second at sub-second finality and average transactions costs of only $0.00001. Such performance at the blockchain layer enables a future in which all game logic can be computed on a suite of on-chain smart applications.

> “Star Atlas is an ideal product to emerge from the confluence of state of the art blockchain, real-time graphics, multiplayer video game, and decentralized financial technologies. Our vision at Star Atlas is to deliver a purely blockchain-driven universe that will change the gaming industry forever.”* Michael Wagner, CFA, — Star Atlas, Co-founder & CEO*

Star Atlas, from the team who built [Multichain Ventures](https://multichain.ventures/), is a AAA title game and blockchain driven virtual metaverse gaming development company. The Multichain Ventures team has been involved in blockchain since 2013, and possesses four years of expertise building decentralized applications. This experience is coupled with eight years shipping AAA titles with Electronic Arts, Mythic Entertainment, 3G Studios and 1047 Games. The ethos of the Star Atlas development team is to encourage the monetization of the time spent in this virtual world, and emphasize the ability for this monetization to transcend the metaverse to the real world. Digital assets owned always belong to the holder, and crypto assets earned can be converted into fiat currencies friction-free. We believe this is the model for the future of gaming.

Solana is a layer 1, Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain with a pBFT-derived consensus mechanism and 200 nodes operating around the world, offering support for 50,000 transactions per second (TPS) speed. Solana achieves such strong performance via a set of coordinated optimizations. Transactions are also processed in parallel by GPU hardware natively, which is a first for blockchains. Previously, all blockchains were single-threaded — Solana is the only blockchain that is multi-threaded.

Solana is an open source project that is stewarded by the Solana Foundation and Solana Labs, Inc., a development consultancy dedicated to building solutions with the Solana blockchain. Solana, Inc. was founded in 2017 by a group of senior ex-Qualcomm employees that specialize in CPU and GPU chip design and optimization, and have worked together for more than a decade.

> “Having Star Atlas integrate into Solana opens up the possibility for a new standard of blockchain gaming. Bringing the traditional gaming experience on-chain and allowing players to own in-game assets as non-fungible tokens and giving an avenue for in-game monetization. This is an exciting integration.” *[Anatoly Yakovenko](mailto:anatoly@solana.com) — Co-Founder, Solana.*

[Solana has grown substantially](https://solana.com/ecosystem) over the course of 2020, with projects such as Serum, Chainlink, Terra, Audius, USDC, and USDT all joining the Solana ecosystem. Here are some high-level stats since Mainnet Beta launch in 2020:

- Over 100 project integrations spanning DeFi, Blockchain Gaming, and Web3 verticals
- 350+ [active validators](https://solanabeach.io/) distributed across the globe
- 8.3 billion transactions on-chain and counting
- Over 54 million blocks have been created
- 4.9 million unique SOL wallets
- 600,000+ global advocates and community members
- The Solana Foundation hosted its first hackathon in Q4 and over 1,000 devs participated in the event

> “The blockchain community is a manifestation of humanity’s truth. Global citizens are in transition to better understand how our individuality is interconnected to a decentralized unified ecosystem. Solana and Star Atlas provide participants a container of free thought and fluid innovation. Their digital environments unleash paradigm shattering innovation and create new efficiencies along value chains to improve user experiences while optimizing value creation for a wide range of community builders.” *Pablo Quiroga — Star Atlas, COO*

Combining the resources of technology, ecosystem, community, expertise, and reverence for transformational experiences, the collaboration between these entities is intended to open a new realm of possibilities. The future of blockchain driven metaverse gaming experiences is brought to you by Star Atlas and Solana, empowering players with a new experiential paradigm.

**ABOUT SOLANA**

Founded by former Qualcomm, Intel, and Dropbox engineers in late-2017, Solana is a single-chain, Proof-of-Stake protocol whose focus is on delivering scalability without sacrificing decentralization or security. Solana can currently handle 50,000 TPS with single transaction costs as low as $0.00001.

Core to Solana’s scaling solution is a decentralized clock titled Proof-of-History (PoH), built to solve the problem of time in distributed networks where there is not a single, trusted, source of time. By using Verifiable Delay Functions, PoH allows each node to locally generate timestamps with SHA256 computations. This eliminates the need for the broadcasts of timestamps across the network, improving overall network efficiency.To learn more, please visit [https://solana.com/](https://solana.com/)
