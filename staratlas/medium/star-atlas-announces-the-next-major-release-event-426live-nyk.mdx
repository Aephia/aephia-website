ATMTA, Inc., developer of Star Atlas, announced that it will hold its second product launch event — [426LIVE:NYK](https://426LIVE.eventbrite.com) (Now You Know)— on September 29, 2022. After holding multiple large-scale events on Discord, the hub of its community, this unveil will be the first that Star Atlas will [livestream on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/StarAtlasGame) with live and prerecorded segments.

The event will mark the culmination of a busy summer season for the gaming and metaverse company. In June, the project held a lively and well attended Council of Peace Assembly (COPA) which celebrated many of the top player guilds within Star Atlas.

That event was followed by the first 426LIVE:IYKYK (If You Know You Know) product launch event that took place on July 21 which featured multiple announcements, including the Star Atlas DAO, a completely redesigned Galactic Marketplace and the StarPath referral program.

The highlight of the upcoming 426LIVE will be the pre-alpha demo release of the Showroom, a first look at the immersive triple-A gaming environment in Unreal Engine 5 with cinematic graphics. As the spectacular Showroom environment is currently an *‘authorized access only’* area, players will need to show appropriate credentials before they are able to enter. More details on access will follow during the event.

Accompanying 426LIVE releases will cover everything from governance within the game to a Star Atlas lore related product, and additional surprise announcements.

Stay tuned for more information in the days leading up to the event.
