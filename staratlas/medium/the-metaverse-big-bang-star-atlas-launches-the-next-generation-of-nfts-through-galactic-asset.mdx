The first in a series of drops of game-changing NFTs in the [Galactic Marketplace](https://play.staratlas.com/market) are state-of-the-art spaceships featuring next-gen design, Unreal Engine 5 real-time graphics and never-before-seen metaverse utility.

![Busan — The Last Stand mk. III /// Player-Owned Next-gen NFT Asset /// Titan Class Spaceship](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/109b118bfbaa309619786a61087bbf2c62067d554e810b62fc6a49ddadb9fb00.png)

As the inaugural unveiling of next-level NFTs to the world, Star Atlas has [launched a Galactic Asset Offering (GAO)](https://play.staratlas.com/market) on September 7, 2021. The ongoing event brings all players, enthusiasts and collectors a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to be part of the future by owning some of the most advanced metaverse NFT assets in existence.

During the GAO, assets are being rolled outhurt individually in limited quantities that will satisfy the initial demand from the community and meet the needs of collectors seeking to get their hands on the very first generation of AAA-grade metaverse NFTs.

Depending on inventory, the assets on offer will follow a simple step-pricing model that rewards early participants while giving the fans who were not fast enough a fair treatment, giving everyone the chance to assemble their desired fleet.

The first two waves of assets come in the form of a range of spaceship NFTs, with sequenced countdowns to drop time displayed on their [Galactic Marketplace page](https://play.staratlas.com/market). The rarity of spaceships increases based on ship class.

As a Genesis Generation of the ships, any consideration of a future release will be carefully measured against the data of capital inflows in the metaverse, asset deflation and any degree of inflation based on supply.

Future releases of the Galactic Asset Offering may also include other assets, but will not include Claim Stake NFTs, which are in the Marketplace due to being dropped to the recipients of Meta-Poster Rewards.

After the supply of assets on offer is exhausted, the items are available in the secondary marketplace on their [Galactic Marketplace page](https://play.staratlas.com/market), joining meta-posters and other assets like the [Tigu space cat](https://play.staratlas.com/market/yWNmeZVXg7My9PMdZGiSx7jsKYkkeCiqHeQbD7zdJeq) already trading there.
