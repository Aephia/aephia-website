ATLAS and POLIS, the two tokens powering the next-gen blockchain gaming metaverse, are set to be released as an Initial exchange offering (IEO) on[ FTX](https://ftx.com/) and an Initial DEX Offering (IDO) on[ Raydium](https://raydium.io/acceleraytor/) and[ Apollo-X](https://apollox.paidnetwork.com/) later this month.

Known for its highly anticipated breakthrough blockchain economic model with Play-to-Earn and DeFi features, Star Atlas is bringing power back to the people with its upcoming public sale. These in-game assets empower the player to exchange resources across the Star Atlas metaverse, create tangible value through exploration, deploy political strategy, and influence the future of game development. A detailed elaboration of the metaverse’s DeFi-powered economic system and its token functionality will be available in the near future.

In partnership with FTX, Raydium and Apollo-X, an allocation of both metaverse tokens will be available to participants eager to experience the future of 21st century economics.

An amount of ATLAS and POLIS tokens equal to $1 million will be allocated through the FTX initial exchange offering. An additional $500,000 of ATLAS and POLIS tokens will be available for sale through the initial decentralized exchange (DEX) offerings on Raydium and Apollo-X. These channels ensure a fair, equal and widely distributed token sale that is in line with the values Star Atlas represents. Further measures will be taken to prevent imbalanced concentration of ownership.

FTX is an innovative cryptocurrency exchange with exponentially increasing product offerings, including blockchain-based derivatives products. Apollo-X is an IDO platform that creates inclusivity in the ecosystem by increasing the opportunities for participating in upcoming and exciting decentralized projects, and will include an exclusive launch party in an outer space virtual world with two DJ sets. Raydium is an automated market maker (AMM) and liquidity provider built on the Solana blockchain for the Serum decentralized exchange (DEX) with a launchpad for exclusive token offerings.

Stay tuned for more news and details in the following days.
