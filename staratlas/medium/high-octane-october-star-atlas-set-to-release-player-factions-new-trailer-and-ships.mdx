*In the most intense feature release week yet, the doors to the blockchain gaming metaverse will begin opening with a new faction selection release.*

The week of October 4-8, 2021 will mark a triple Star Atlas event that will bring something for every metaverse enthusiast and intergalactic explorer.

### The Doors to the Mini-Game Open

First, on Tuesday, October 5 at 10 PM EDT [*please note the PM time*], the first level of the mini-game will open to all players, allowing them to set up their profiles, strategize, organize and prepare for the future release by selecting their faction and introducing faction leaderboards. It will also allow guilds to begin positioning themselves to gain competitive advantage based on their goals.

These first-ever features represent a technological frontier that has never been accessed before, integrating the blockchain with a vast 3D metaverse and a fully player-owned gaming environment, and we are looking forward to working with our community to make sure that any bumps along the way are smoothed out and the sheer scale of the system provides an excellent experience for everyone.

Please be aware that releases also depend on the current technical state and limitations of the blockchain, and our ability to tackle any arising situation, making the precise live release and drop timings subject to that factor.

### The Trailer

Then, on Wednesday, October 6 at 9 AM EDT, the [full-length game trailer](https://youtu.be/ciFSSd39pAY) will premiere on YouTube. If you wondered what the first cinematic[ Teaser Trailer](https://youtu.be/hnFNh-1qLWk) was about, this grand reveal will answer many of your questions about the game and inspire you to take galactic destiny into your own hands. You can look forward to seeing the many aspects of the Star Atlas metaverse for the very first time. Strap yourself in before [watching](https://youtu.be/ciFSSd39pAY) and prepare to be transported into an entirely new dimension. [Set yourself a reminder](https://youtu.be/ciFSSd39pAY) to watch it live on YouTube.
