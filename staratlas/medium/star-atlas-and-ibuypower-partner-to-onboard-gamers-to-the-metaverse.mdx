Star Atlas, a next-gen metaverse with triple-A game design and Unreal Engine 5 graphics built on the Solana blockchain, today announced its partnership with iBUYPOWER, a leading manufacturer of custom gaming PCs, and now the official computer hardware provider of Star Atlas. This is the first step in a long-term relationship to onboard new gamers to the metaverse.

> “We’re really excited to join forces with iBUYPOWER to accelerate the adoption of web3 gaming,” said Michael Wagner, Co-Founder and CEO of ATMTA, Inc., the principal development studio of Star Atlas. “We recognize there is skepticism amongst gamer communities around web3 gaming, and we’re happy to partner with the leading gaming hardware maker because we understand the needs of traditional gamers. iBUYPOWER builds great products, and we’re thrilled they share our vision and want to introduce their gaming community to the Star Atlas metaverse so they see what the future of gaming looks like.”

To celebrate this partnership, iBUYPOWER will be sponsoring the inaugural COPA, the first Star Atlas community event, by giving away a customized Atlas PC for the main competition. More details regarding the competition can be found in Star Atlas’ official social media channels.

> Darren Su, Executive Vice President of iBUYPOWER, commented, “We love Michael and his team’s vision for Star Atlas, and we love that they’re focused on supporting their dedicated community. We’re thrilled to be able to power an AAA-quality metaverse on the blockchain, and this is going to be a great opportunity to help onboard our gamers into web3 with a game we know they’ll enjoy. The computers we’re customizing for Star Atlas are out of this world, and they’re going to be a high-power, quality build we know our gamers and Star Atlas fans alike will love.”

Beyond COPA, Star Atlas and iBUYPOWER plans include the commercialization of a range of equipment that will help blur the lines between the physical world and the Metaverse, and the inclusion of iBUYPOWER as one of the pioneering members of the Star Atlas ecosystem.
