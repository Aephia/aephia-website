*Star Atlas DAO, StarPath, Galactic Marketplace and iBUYPOWER Tech Store*

![During the virtual event, the Star Atlas team unveiled the latest Star Atlas Summer updates including a new galactic NFT marketplace and more.](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/b893c5792d2eb864b318aa69a6ba0f0f98f38f56c5230ee37634954c683558f6.png)

Yesterday, Star Atlas hosted 426LIVE, a community-focused event announcing a series of product releases, including the highly-anticipated launch of the Star Atlas Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO).

Michael Wagner, our Co-Founder, and CEO of ATMTA, Inc., commented, “The vision for Star Atlas is a DAO of DAOs, operating at these various levels of the game, utilizing a variety of on-chain tools to manage in-game assets and treasuries, coordinating activities using the blockchain’s trustless and decentralized nature. We are committed to building these tools and delivering them to our community over the next months and years.”

As many members of the Star Atlas community predicted, 426LIVE deployed the first version of the DAO structure, namely [the Star Atlas DAO](https://medium.com/star-atlas/the-star-atlas-dao-the-game-of-polis-fd3798aa6ebe). POLIS is Star Atlas’ governance token, and in the future, this DAO will allow players within the metaverse to participate in its governance on all levels. The long-term vision of the Star Atlas metaverse is an autonomous, player-owned game, fully controlled and funded by decentralized governance. This allows players to determine the future of the metaverse, enabling them to steer the course of the project over time. Players can go to govern.staratlas.com to participate.

[The Star Atlas DAO](https://medium.com/star-atlas/the-star-atlas-dao-the-game-of-polis-fd3798aa6ebe), however, is not the only DAO planned for the Star Atlas metaverse. Each of the three in-game factions will have its own DAO, which will be used for various purposes such as setting and distributing taxes for their respective controlled regions.

With the launch of the Star Atlas DAO, POLIS locking was also announced. POLIS holders will be able to commit their tokens for any amount of time up to five years. This voting-escrow model is designed to favor community members with long-term conviction in the Star Atlas vision, to help the Star Atlas team deliver a fun game and a framework for developers and content creators to build in the metaverse.

**Additional Star Atlas Summer announcements include:**

[Galactic Marketplace](https://medium.com/star-atlas/the-new-galactic-marketplace-a-small-step-for-trading-a-huge-leap-for-the-star-atlas-metaverse-a7c4a44ee7f8):** Since its launch in 2021, the Galactic Marketplace has been the hub of the metaverse economy. Now, Star Atlas announced a complete revamp of the marketplace, with new DAO-enabled gaming foundations, a smooth user experience, and a new interface that brings the platform closer to the feel of an in-game experience on both larger desktop screens and mobile. Additionally, players will now be able to buy and sell assets directly with other players, giving the marketplace a true MMO-style community feel.

[Star Path Program:](https://medium.com/star-atlas/starpath-the-official-star-atlas-referral-program-a08623af0c6a) The Star Atlas team also announced their new next-gen web3 referral initiative, StarPath, focused on building and sustaining the Star Atlas ecosystem by rewarding space explorers who enlist new recruits. The referral program is designed to reward not only the players bringing other active players to Star Atlas, but also to fuel competition between in-game factions to be the top recruiting force. Individual players can redeem their points, or Prosperity Marks, for ships or other in-game assets, and the most successful faction will receive in-game buff — allowing players to enhance their characters. Going forward, the StarPath program will also unlock a range of blockchain-enabled perks and access to otherwise unattainable resources.

[iBUYPOWER Tech Store](https://medium.com/star-atlas/ibuypower-to-offer-custom-star-atlas-branded-gaming-gear-e6e5044c495b):** Finally, after announcing iBUYPOWER as the [official computer hardware provider of Star Atlas](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/star-atlas-and-ibuypower-partner-to-onboard-gamers-to-the-metaverse-301562753.html), Star Atlas and iBUYPOWER launched the iBUYPOWER Tech Store which will feature a full line of Star Atlas branded high-end hardware, with top-quality designs selected by the Star Atlas community.

“We’re very excited to be able to offer these new features to our community,” commented Pablo Quiroga, co-founder of Star Atlas and CRO of ATMTA, Inc. “We value each and every member, and we always want to put our community first. We want to continue to empower the Star Atlas community, and we’re happy to be able to reward them during Star Atlas summer. The Star Atlas DAO and locking, Galactic Marketplace, iBUYPOWER Tech Store, and StarPath referral program are just the beginning, and we can’t wait to show the community what’s coming next.”

We are only getting started.
