ATMTA, the leading developer behind *Star Atlas*, has entered into a strategic equity investment with Shaga, an innovative decentralized cloud gaming platform. This partnership includes an investment in *Star Atlas* game assets, the $ATLAS token, and marketing support designed to support user growth and improve accessibility for players globally. By integrating Shaga’s advanced streaming technology, *Star Atlas* aims to expand its reach across platforms, reduce hardware barriers, and invite a broader audience into its Web3 gaming universe.

**Advancing Gaming Accessibility**

Shaga introduces a fresh approach to cloud gaming by utilizing existing gaming PCs as Shaga Nodes, enabling players to contribute to infrastructure and transforming local communities into virtual arcades.

This decentralized model minimizes reliance on distant servers, offering low-latency gameplay. For *Star Atlas* and its triple-A massively multiplayer online real-time strategy (MMORTS) vision, this means players can access its high-fidelity immersive worlds on a range of devices — PCs, laptops, tablets, or smartphones — without requiring high-end hardware. This collaboration opens opportunities for gamers in regions like Southeast Asia (SEA) and Latin America (LATAM), as well as those from diverse economic backgrounds, to experience *Star Atlas* more easily.

Michael Wagner, CEO of ATMTA, commented, “This partnership with Shaga is about making *Star Atlas* more inclusive. We’ve crafted a game that explores new frontiers — space exploration, Web3 ownership, and strategic gameplay — and Shaga’s technology helps us bring that vision to more people by reducing hardware limitations.”

**A Boost for Star Atlas**

For *Star Atlas*, this investment is a strategic step toward enhancing its position in the gaming industry. By leveraging Shaga’s capabilities, ATMTA aims to grow its “Cybernation” — a global community of players engaging in exploration, trading, and competition in Star Atlas blockchain universe. The partnership supports *Star Atlas*’s goal of delivering a seamless, accessible experience, aligning with its commitment to innovation and inclusivity in Web3 gaming.

**Shaga’s Technological Contribution**

Shaga’s decentralized network employs edge computing to provide efficient, high-quality streaming tailored to varying internet speeds and device capabilities. This ensures that *Star Atlas*’s resource-intensive gameplay and real-time mechanics remain smooth and responsive, even on less powerful devices.

Guido Pardini, CEO of Shaga, noted, “*Star Atlas* offers a forward-thinking vision for gaming, and Shaga is enhancing how players access it. We’re working toward a future where idle gaming PCs power a peer-driven network, delivering quality gameplay on demand with minimal latency. This partnership also fosters a shared economy where players can contribute to and benefit from the system.”

**Benefits for Players and Communities**

The ATMTA-Shaga partnership seeks to provide several practical advantages:

- **Enhanced Accessibility**: Reduces the need for costly hardware, making *Star Atlas* available to a wider audience and promoting inclusivity globally.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Allows gameplay across multiple devices with consistent progress, enabling flexibility for players.
- **Reliable Streaming**: Delivers low-latency performance essential for *Star Atlas*’s strategic elements, even on modest setups.
- **Global Availability**: Enables participation from any location with an internet connection, supporting players in underserved areas and mobile lifestyles.
- **Community Connection**: Links streamers and players worldwide, enhancing engagement and visibility within Shaga’s ecosystem.

**Shaping the Future of Gaming**

By combining Shaga’s cloud-based infrastructure with *Star Atlas*’s Web3 features, this partnership ensures consistent access to in-game assets and a unified experience across platforms. A significant milestone is set to improve player’s experience, attract new users to web3 gaming, and build a dynamic, inclusive community that connects creators and gamers globally.

Join us in the journey towards the future!
