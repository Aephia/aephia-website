*A [revolutionary contest](https://staratlas.com/partnerships/sandbox-star-atlas) to kick off metaverse interoperability offers you a chance to win a fleet of spaceship NFTs and SAND*

Those familiar with [Star Atlas](https://staratlas.com/) know that living on the frontier of tomorrow is all about space exploration, collaboration and adventure. Even as we continue to build out our metaverse, we’re constantly on the hunt for people and creative communities who share our values.

That’s why we’re thrilled to announce a new partnership with our friends at [The Sandbox](https://www.sandbox.game/en/)!

The Sandbox is a wildly popular community-driven platform where creators can monetize voxel assets and gaming experiences on the Ethereum blockchain. Read more about The Sandbox below.

## **The Contest**

Hold on to your voxelized space helmets! This cross metaverse space-themed contest — the first of its kind — will give you a chance to use your creativity to make your mark on our shared history and win valuable prizes.

## **Your Mission**

Imagine a trip to a territory controlled by one of the three main Star Atlas factions — MUD, ONI or USTUR — and create your very own NPC (non-player character) of a being you would meet there. Use the free [VoxEdit software](https://www.sandbox.game/en/create/vox-edit/), the NFT creator for The Sandbox, to bring your character to life.

While exploring the galaxy, you also get inspired by the cosmic marvels to fill the void with sound and creativity and design an immersive and entertaining headpiece for the NPC with [VoxEdit software](https://www.sandbox.game/en/create/vox-edit/). Get inspired by the astral beats from BLOND:ISH, the metaverse artist and creator who already lives and creates on both Star Atlas and The Sandbox ecosystems.
