Welcome back, explorers! We’re excited to share the latest patch notes for February’s update. Before diving into the new enhancements, let’s quickly revisit the highlights from last December.

**Last December’s Highlights**

As 2024 came to a close, we launched the Star Atlas Unreal Engine 5 Private Preseason — our most significant update yet. It introduced new game modes, enhancements, and multiplayer features, making the Galia Expanse more accessible and enjoyable for our players.

Here’s a glance at the major updates:

**Crewcards V0 Integration**

We introduced a crew system to the Unreal Engine 5 client, enabling players to interact with their crew members for the first time. Though character arts are still under development, this initial step offers a sneak peek at the unique, customized experiences awaiting in Galia Expanse.

**Deathmatch Modes in Paizul’s Arena**

This new exciting map allows players to engage in quick, intense three-way team and free-for-all battles in public lobbies, using unique species, accessories, and weapons from Star Atlas.

**Multiplayer Racing Tracks**

We’ve added two thrilling maps on Planet Ioki’s sands for self-hosted racing lobbies. These high-speed tracks are designed to enhance our community’s competitive spirit.

**New Single-Player Test Modes**

Players can now explore two new environments in the Galia Expanse universe:

- **ONI Faction Central Space Station**: Navigate the expansive capital of the ONI Consortium and discover its district-by-district intricacies as it grows to be an economic metropolis of the Star Atlas metaverse
- **Project Galia**: This experimental mode invites players to fly through space, exploring sectors and discovering planets, previewing the future of Star Atlas.

**Fleet Command Test Mode**

The Unreal Engine 5 iteration of our blockchain SAGE game, Fleet Command, offers a real-time view of SAGE fleets across the galaxy, with feature parity expected later this year.
