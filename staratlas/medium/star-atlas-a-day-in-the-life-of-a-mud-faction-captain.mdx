![In-game Space Station WIP /// Player-Owned In-game Asset /// Immersive Intergalactic Metaverse](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/ab24a5879e69a4afa076acf3a9b53c0c521a8dc6fb7c6fb81b31f8bcb0d4a105.jpeg)

*The supply run was supposed to be easy — dash in, hand off, zip out.*

Your contact at the [Galactic Marketplace](https://play.staratlas.com/market) insisted on a flight path that involved a leg beyond the Security Zone, but the risk would be worth it, you thought. Half of the [ATLAS](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/star-atlas/) was paid up front to cover munitions reloads and fuel, but you needed the rest for new shield plating for your ship, the *Torch of* *Ulysses*. Repairs after the last shootout are holding her hull together, but she’s in need of an overhaul.

Now, rogue ONI alien pirates are on your tail, and no friendlies from your faction — MUD, the alliance of humankind — are within reach to offer assistance. It’s up to you and your crew to engage the ONI head on or peel out at max speed to shake them — if your crew can sustain the burn.

These ONI ships are lighter than your own, but they outnumber you — three to one. One bears unique markings that you recognize — thick etchings painted red like new scars. You’ve heard the stories about a crew of ONI marauders who never lose their bounty; will you be the next one of the captains drunk at Central Station if you don’t make it home?

Your gunner fires two shots. One hits home, the other loops back but misses again. Your pilot punches it. Maybe, with a little skill and luck, you’ll make it home. A new alert sounds — the signature registers an USTUR ship barreling towards you. The gentle androids were given form and thought by multi-generational artificial intelligence and are usually amicable, but there’s no telling what they’re after on this deep space frontier. They hail your ship…

## Factional Clashes

This is just one example of starting your day in the metaverse where mundane reality pales in comparison.

The three factions of Star Atlas — MUD, ONI, USTUR — are locked in a galactic-scale peace treaty under which broods an equally grand conflict. As a citizen of Star Atlas, every one of your actions determines how far the reach of your faction and guild extends into deep, dark space. Exert economic dominance by amassing [ATLAS](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/star-atlas/), the in-game currency, which gives you the means to acquire spacecraft, space stations, equipment, and land. Or get a hold of [POLIS](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/star-atlas-polis/) to wield political influence across the cosmos and shape the future of the world in Star Atlas.

As a player, you leave a unique imprint on the world around you and on your faction. This permanently shapes how you interact with other players, be they friend or foe, as well as the way you access a marketplace to make unique cosmetic and functional upgrades to your ship and avatar.

Define your play style as a trader, miner, hauler, sentry, bounty hunter, data scanner, a diplomat or any number of other roles to serve your fellow faction members or even lead them to supremacy.

## High Stakes on the Blockchain

As the [Teaser Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnFNh-1qLWk) shows, Star Atlas is where metaverse gaming meets blockchain technology in an vast open world. It’s a game for enterprising players who are ready to unearth the riches of the galaxy, recruit the toughest crew, operate one-of-a-kind spacecraft augmented with hand-picked components, and ultimately carve out one’s own land and space after waging epic battles and embarking on history-making adventures.

The more time you spend in the interstellar metaverse of Star Atlas, the more ATLAS and POLIS you’ll have at your disposal to make acquisitions in the marketplace and formulate real-world economic direction, or extract the tokens for real-world income. Leave the enforced safety of Security Zones for higher stakes combat, greater mining yields, and factional prestige.

In-game assets — ships, gear, land, space stations, skins and so on — are stored as NFTs (non-fungible tokens) on the blockchain, so they can be bought and sold on Serum’s DEX with near-instant settlement and near-zero fees, or traded on other cryptocurrency networks. Losing these assets, like if a ship is blown up in a skirmish or a brutal turf war, means they’re gone forever, tokens burned to leave behind drifting space debris.

This is Star Atlas. The year is 2620. Prepare for deep space exploration, combat, diplomacy, and conquest by visiting the new next-gen website experience [https://staratlas.com](https://staratlas.com).
