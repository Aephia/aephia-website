*The quarterly paper of record offers economic insight into the world’s fastest growing ecosystem of the gaming metaverse.*

![State of the Economy /// Insight Into Star Atlas Metaverse Economic Boom /// Quarterly Metaverse Paper of Record](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/9de8ee51c2e3c00be303ab89cca01c1b8f4696548c515f368ddbde649e8b66b9.png)

The Department of Economics at ATMTA, Inc., the developer of Star Atlas, has unveiled its latest edition of its flagship [report entitled *State of the Economy](https://staratlas.com/newsroom/economic-reports)*, complete with a comprehensive set of tools and data for a birds-eye view of the Star Atlas economy. The research paper, which aims to inform community members and spur public discussion regarding economic trends in the Star Atlas ecosystem, is the second quarterly report issued after the inaugural report dropped in June.

The report highlights how the deepening bear market continues to impact Star Atlas along with other metaverse projects and the broader market. While Star Atlas ship prices have retraced, they have outperformed the metaverse gaming token index, POLIS and ATLAS, since March 1st.

Other significant events impacted prices and the labor pool during the period. For example, the announcement on July 15 by ATMTA that it would be repricing primary market ship pairs denominated in ATLAS caused a surge in sales during the following six days, likely bringing forward in time future ship purchases.

> “Despite challenging market conditions, including substantial headwinds in the global macroeconomy, we are pleased to report a modest decoupling within the virtual economy of Star Atlas,” commented Michael Wagner, Co-Founder of Star Atlas and CEO of ATMTA, Inc., its development studio. “S.C.O.R.E. continues to maintain the stability of ship markets, while growth in the labor force broadened across all ship classes, a welcome change from the previous report.”

## **Key Report Highlights**

The report provides data and insights in a range of other categories. Highlights include:

- Aggregate daily ATLAS wages grew by 4.4%
- The average wage per ship declined by -9.5%
- The aggregate employment rate per ship decreased by -0.44%
- The size of the labor force grew by 14.3%
- Ship prices fell by -8.5%
- The market value of ships outstanding increased by 5.9%

All of the growth in aggregate wages occurred during July due to the increased accumulation of higher-class ships. Their addition pushed up average ATLAS wages by 5.8%, accounting for most of the growth in total ATLAS emissions over the three months.

## **Census Highlights**

Like the first edition, the report includes a census of the Star Atlas ecosystem. A total of 12,591 new people entered the Star Atlas universe since the last census. In contrast, 4,802 left the universe. An additional 1,635 people became residents.

Although citizens represent just 2.2% of the population, they command significant influence at 22.2% of the total wealth. Since they also represent the majority of the participants in POLIS locking, this small group, which includes DACs (guilds), now controls the bulk of future political power.

## **Wages, employment and earnings by class**

The team devised a new statistical approach for a more accurate picture of the labor market compared to the previous report. At the surface level, the aggregate labor market summary points to a continuation of the first Quarterly trends. But digging deeper, there has been a broad level of growth in the labor force and a general improvement in conditions.

For example, the labor pool grew the most for XXS ships at 17.4%, followed by Capital ships at 12.8%. Net wages grew a healthy 15.3% for Capital ships, and average net wages per ship increased for Capital and Large class ships.

“Kudos to the Econ team as they continue to adapt their reporting — including adjusting the definition of who qualifies as a citizen with the addition of POLIS locking — to stay relevant as the Star Atlas ecosystem evolves,” Wagner added.

## **Net ATLAS Earnings by Class**

For the period, Capital ships continued to have the lowest effective tax rate at 12.9%, followed by Commander ships at 13.8%, while XXS small ships continued to have the highest tax rate at 23.7%.

## **DAO Revenue**

S.C.O.R.E is the primary source of ATLAS emissions into the ecosystem. From June 1st through August 31st, Residents and Citizens claimed 505.54 million ATLAS (+5.495 million per day) in gross employment earnings. In addition, 89.05 million ATLAS (-.968 million per day) flowed back into the DAO from the ATLAS sale of resources. Another 293.6 million ATLAS (-3.191 million per day) was absorbed through the sale of primary origination ships denominated in ATLAS. After accounting for the ATLAS sinks, net ATLAS emissions totaled 122.89 million (or +1.34 million per day); as a result, over 75% of the ATLAS emitted through S.C.O.R.E. never left the ecosystem.
