*We are once again listing ships in the [Galactic Marketplace](http://play.staratlas.com/market/?utm_medium=medium&utm_campaign=s23a) for primary sales in ATLAS — with an added 20% discount on these sales. Ships had been previously available for sale in ATLAS, but were temporarily made unavailable in late 2022.*

With this move, much more of the total ship inventory supply is once again available, ready to fuel the growing Star Atlas economy and satisfy the demand for upcoming game feature releases, including the browser-based SAGE gaming loop and the updated Unreal Engine 5 game client.

All returning ship assets will have their initial prices in ATLAS based on a rolling seven-day average of the token’s price in USDC (in the final 7 days of May 2023), and prices will be readjusted periodically.

The entire lineup of assets made available anew on the ATLAS pair with a 20% discount represents 50 percent of all remaining available inventory, with the other half being available on the USDC pair at full price. The 20% discount on the ATLAS pair will remain in effect until further notice.

Individual assets listed under both ATLAS and USDC pairs will have the same pricing step structure as before, adjusted for the remaining available primary sale supply.

Head to the [Galactic Marketplace](http://play.staratlas.com/market/?utm_medium=medium&utm_campaign=s23a) in the newly released [Showroom R 2.1](https://store.epicgames.com/p/star-atlas-bead34) on the Epic Games Store or a [web browser](http://play.staratlas.com/market/?utm_medium=medium&utm_campaign=s23a) now to see the assets on offer in ATLAS.

Among the added ships is also *the [Fimbul ECOS Superphoenix](https://play.staratlas.com/market/2BMTgfgapuqYBwSRGu6HCafwDGRVTxMkQVhYrNWQGTWH/?utm_medium=medium&utm_campaign=s23a), available in ATLAS at 80% discount for a limited time*.
