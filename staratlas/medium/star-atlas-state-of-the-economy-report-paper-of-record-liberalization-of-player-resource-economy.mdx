*The quarterly paper of record offers novel economic insight into the world’s fastest growing ecosystem of the gaming metaverse.*

![State of the Economy /// Insight Into Star Atlas Metaverse Economic Boom /// Quarterly Metaverse Paper of Record](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/6dab73c3943307bd4ea6cf1bd0cdbc2ccb332b137184d075786711305f9da305.png)

The latest Star Atlas “State of the Economy Report” edition capturing Q2 of 2023 is out now. This report covers the changes brought about by the transition to a player resource production economy. Topics such as Escape Velocity resource emissions, faction claims, and Faction Fleet (SCORE) employment are explored in depth to shed light on the extensive effects of the economic shock. View the report **here**.

The report goes into the supply and demand for resources, and delves into the peer-to-peer economy. It is important to recognize that those that consume resources will not always be the same ones producing them. This is highlighted in the figure below which breaks out the demand for resources by group in Faction Fleet (left-hand side), versus the supply of resources by group (right-side). What is evident is that claim stakes act as the most stable form of supply.

This fact is translated elsewhere in the environment. Particularly when it comes to the peer-to-peer side of the economy. To gauge the impact of a particular source of supply on the overall market we can calculate the net purchases, so simply the resource purchases less sales of that source. The figure breaks down the net purchases of resources for three primary groups: Those in Faction Fleet (SCORE) without claim stakes; those with claim stakes; and wallets with fleets in Escape Velocity (and no other category). The stability found in the production of resources from claim stakes is translated into a reliable source of supply for the marketplace.
