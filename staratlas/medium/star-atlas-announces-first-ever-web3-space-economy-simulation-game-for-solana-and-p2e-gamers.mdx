*SAGE Labs is an early access browser-based open-world game with real-time gameplay, total freedom of action and a life-like economy where players can gather, craft, trade and prosper, all entirely on Solana.*

In another world-first by Star Atlas, SAGE Labs is a gameplay release that strengthens the game ecosystem’s leadership position in the web3 industry, and opens up the Star Atlas economy to a worldwide audience.

SAGE Labs offers a rich economic loop for play-to-earn (P2E) players and web3 gaming enthusiasts in search of immersive, fun and engaging gaming experiences that capture their in-game time and effort as tangible value. This is possible through the use of fully secure, truly player-owned and controlled Star Atlas assets.

SAGE Labs features the most advanced technology stack in a blockchain-enabled web3 game, with the entire game logic and game state stored on the blockchain. The release expands integration with other Star Atlas features and with the wider Solana ecosystem, including by enabling new web3 features in the StarPath referral program, which now offers a 10% referral discount to new players and an additional 25% purchase value share for the referrers.

Soon to be released live on Solana Mainnet, the fully on-chain gameplay with ultimate freedom of action sets this title apart from other web3 games. The completely decentralized, first-of-a-kind economic game module also enables any developer to use its programs and infrastructure to build new tools and even gameplay solutions.

SAGE Labs is a simulation of a real-life economic system featuring advanced gameplay mechanics, focusing on deep space resource extraction and crafting. In order to create a fully closed loop in this rollout phase, the release is accompanied by an unprecedented $1.5 million Golden Ticket promotion. With a 2D interface designed for economic participation, SAGE Labs is playable in any Solana-enabled web browser.

Heavily anticipated by the worldwide Star Atlas community, SAGE Labs fully integrates in the Star Atlas ecosystem. The game activates the assets that players own and can purchase on the Galactic Marketplace, bringing large-scale utility to the in-game currency ATLAS and its circular economy. Players can also use items from the game interchangeably with other current and future gameplay features.

> *“SAGE Labs propels the entire web3 industry to new heights. It represents the next generation of P2E, bringing opportunities and enormous economic potential to players worldwide. In this pivotal moment for our booming game economy, the real winners of exponential growth are the citizens of the Star Atlas metaverse.”*

> — Michael Wagner, Co-founder of Star Atlas and CEO of ATMTA, Inc.

SAGE Labs gets its name from Star Atlas Golden Era (SAGE), a full-feature Star Atlas browser game in the making. Originally developed and used as an econometric game development tool, it showcases two dimensional real-life economic gameplay. This release will enable players to get familiar with the game mechanics of SAGE as well as improve future releases.

SAGE Labs is a precursor to an upcoming SAGE release titled SAGE: Starbased, which is poised to become the biggest fully on-chain browser game in blockchain history. Starbased will launch with complete 3D graphics, an expanded immersive gameplay and will feature around 20 fully on-chain complex Solana programs forming a real-life economic loop.

In the current release, SAGE Labs has limited UI and features a reduced number of gameplay loops. The $1.5 million dollar loot table with Golden Tickets stands in place of the closed loop economy with starbase crafting, upgrading, and destruction, which players will be able to experience in SAGE: Starbased.

SAGE Labs is also the successor to SAGE: Escape Velocity, the record-breaking on-chain space movement gameplay feature, which became the blockchain game with the highest total transaction volume ever with over 80 million transactions.

## **Feature Highlights**

SAGE Labs brings new core game logic and enhanced building blocks of all current and future gameplay features, including a new decentralized character management system and an ATLAS transaction fee payment system.

The game features fleet management with individual ship stats, a resource extraction and freighting loop, a crafting loop, a data runner loop, a redemption loop in the form of ships, CSS Plots, and Golden Tickets, ATLAS sinks and additional utility.

All game assets are on-chain, with dozens of new ones being introduced to the marketplace. With the game running on the Solana Mainnet, players will be able to use their spaceships and other in-game assets in real time.

> *“This is the dawn of a truly open economy. Players can trade any item — resources, components, items and Golden Tickets with others, and spend their in-game currency in a myriad of ways, such as buying in-game items and ships in the Galactic Marketplace, storing it in the ATLAS Locker and buying merchandise.* *In Star Atlas, even rocks have tangible real-world value.”*

## **Gameplay Highlights**

In SAGE Labs, players use text-based menus to perform resources-consuming actions, and a 2D map to**navigate** across the vast space of 51 star systems featured in this release. Notably, players can perform and discontinue any action in real time. Due to the full integration with the entire Star Atlas ecosystem, players can use items in the game interchangeably in the Galactic Marketplace, in Faction Fleet, Faction Claims and in future versions of SAGE.

Players start their galactic expansion from a faction**Central Space Station** located in the starting zone of their chosen Star Atlas faction (MUD, ONI or Ustur). They move on to faction**Starbases** in other star systems as they start exploring deeper space. At these structures, they are able to gather fleets of spaceships, with which they can venture further into space to**scan** for valuable data (SDUs) and resources*,*extract** them and use them for**crafting**. Players’ success in this economy loop will depend mainly on the composition of their fleet — ships each having a unique set of characteristics and stats, some of which have a distinct advantage in the mining, crafting and extraction economy loop.**

**Exploration —** All 51 star systems or Sectors are available for**exploration** and scanning by player fleets and located in both starting and medium risk zones. Fleets can scan to retrieve Survey Data Units (SDUs), which is a component for crafting Golden Tickets and which can also be exchanged for loot rewards. Fleet movement across the map in all directions consumes a varying degree of resources — fuel, food and ammo, which any fleet carries in finite amounts. If a fleet runs out of resources, players need to pay an ATLAS fee to be able to respawn it at a Starbase, while any loot or resources carried by that fleet will be lost.

**Extraction —** Players can then**extract resources** by mining asteroids within asteroid belts and fields found in various star systems. The farther players venture from their faction’s Central Space Station, the more rare and higher quality resources they are able to find. There is a limited selection of 9 different raw resources available in SAGE Labs. Mining consumes two of three basic ship resources — food and ammo.

**Crafting —** Players are able to**craft** at either a Central Space Station or a Starbase. While crafting speed depends on the number of ship crew assigned to a task, the players will be able to craft an assortment of items and further crafting components for more advanced crafting recipes. The crafting loop consists of creating materials, producing components from them and assembling them into increasingly more complex and valuable items.

## **$1.5 Million Golden Ticket Event**

The much anticipated Golden Ticket event is the culmination of the SAGE Labs economy loop. The campaign is split into 2 parts.

The first is a redemption program where players can amass a large number of the crafted assets and turn them in for a limited list of Star Atlas’ ships, claim stakes, or Central Space Station (CSS) land NFTs — the pool totalling $300,000 USDC in VWAP. While most players will not be able to single handedly go out and craft one of these massive assets, it provides a vibrant labor market for players to participate in. These redemptions will notably require Survey Data Units in addition to crafted assets as inputs.

The second part is a massive, weekly drawing worth $150,000 USDC in VWAP per week for 8 weeks, a total of $1.2 million in VWAP. In addition to the Star Atlas redemption assets mentioned in the section above, players will be able to craft a very rare item called a Golden Ticket. This is a player-owned blockchain asset that requires every single craftable item in the game to create. While it is a complex recipe, players with Golden Tickets may choose to put them towards the weekly draw where their chances of claiming a prize from the drawing are proportional to the number of tickets they have put forth.
