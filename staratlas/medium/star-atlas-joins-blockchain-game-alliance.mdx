Efforts include:

- Strategic Partnership
- Industry Awareness
- Events and Speaking Opportunities

The Star Atlas team is proud to announce that they’ve joined the [Blockchain Game Alliance](http://www.blockchaingamealliance.org), the largest coalition of gaming and blockchain companies committed to advocating for blockchain technology in the game industry. The BGA includes such notable names as Ubisoft, ConsenSys, Algorand, Tezos, Animoca, and AMD, among others.

BGA’s ultimate goal is to spread awareness around the blockchain ecosystem and encourage its adoption by highlighting the vast potential that the technology possesses to create, publish, play, and build strong communities around games.

The idea of building a massive multiplayer online metaverse through an open-source blockchain protocol is a relatively new one, and Solana’s technology has the promise of making things never thought possible real. As blockchain technology continues to evolve toward enhanced capabilities, innovative development possibilities emerge. Star Atlas is marrying innovative blockchain mechanics with traditional game mechanics to develop a fully unique gaming experience.

> “What we’re doing has never been done before. Scaling Star Atlas is challenging, and especially complex due to its cross-cultural reach. Working alongside other companies with innovative business models looking to disrupt the gaming industry will afford us valuable insight, allowing our team to move fast — spelling the difference between success and failure,” said [Michael Wagner](https://twitter.com/at_mwagner), CFA, co-founder and CEO of Star Atlas.

By partnering with the Blockchain Game Alliance, the Star Atlas team will be part of a vital community of mission-aligned organizations committed to the future of gaming. Here’s to what’s next.
