*Next-gen on-chain merch designed by [The Fabricant](https://www.thefabricant.com/) features exclusive Star Atlas digital couture with legendary and epic metaverse attributes, the first-ever in-game NFT collection of its kind.*

![FIRMAM3NTAL: STAR✶MAKERS /// Digital Fashion Collection /// Star Atlas x The Fabricant](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/a890a6d731964504f479de89af73ae22567755ec24bdf1f6f5bf4c3848fe60bb.gif)

The FIRMAM3NTAL: STAR✶MAKERS collection consists of five limited-edition and open-edition item categories. Each one is authenticated by Star Atlas and available through the [Galactic Marketplace](https://play.staratlas.com/market) until the supply runs out or until the sale window closes. The sale begins on **September 16, 2021 at 6 pm Pacific Time** and ends on September 26, 2021 at 5:00 PM PDT.

By acquiring digital fashion items, the purchasers mint the NFTs to own them and are subsequently able to trade them in a decentralized marketplace.

FIRMAM3NTAL: STAR✶MAKERS collection is made using the highest quality digital garment manufacturing processes and embodies the Star Atlas vision to take all early enthusiasts worldwide and explorers by heart on the inaugural journey of inner expansion. It marks the collective genesis moment of the metaverse that connects all participants and partners into a single yet individuized whole.

With real-time graphic quality of [Unreal Engine 5](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/unreal-engine-5) and the near-instantaneous speed of the [Solana](https://solana.com/) blockchain at near-zero settlement costs, this lavish and unique first-of-a-kind collection is the mark that will highly distinguish the very first metaverse inhabitants.

The collection puts four high-tech items on offer: the legendary [PRIMORDIAL GLO Bomber Jacket](https://play.staratlas.com/market/6GgPHefcbFu78kE9GZg3z1A9eHAaXeCPMqdjhRscFDSL) (from Galactic Love Outfitters), and the epic [COSMIC ORIGIN 92 eL.eM.eN.tAL Jersey [CO92E]](https://play.staratlas.com/market/3AuyQppPMFToedMm8Xf1x79CfDUzpzLDorHHQmf11Rzy) and [NXT le]V[el DS Bodysuit Glow-up](https://play.staratlas.com/market/ChJKLWcHQb4VXFmA9Q9gjLvRapkboUvWCfCfqmLsnhSw) (New Exoplanetary Textiles Co.), as well as the [PhotoniX Provenance Primal Origin Neckwear](https://play.staratlas.com/market/Fjcdi6CJJqvy2aSknEodKheB1dYVD9rdtZMJNjFo8Fck).

Additionally, the fifth category of wearables consists of the TTT 300K — Tribal Transcendence Tags that can be attached to the straps of the garments and thus further individuize them, enabling wearers to fly the colors of key Star Atlas ecosystem partners.

> *“The *Fabricant is the world leader in digital fashion. The products and opportunities coming out of our relationship enable truly free expression as well as creating value for the worldwide lifestyle community. This cooperation is expanding the absolute limits of what is possible in the metaverse and beyond, and enhancing the immersive experience for all Star Atlas fans. We’re honored to be working with the design team on revolutionizing the relationship between digital and physical, creating a fully functional metaverse-centric transformational experience that is out of this world. The Fabricant is not just a partner of Star Atlas; they are our companions on a journey of inward expansion of the human species, traveling on the frontier of manifesting our collective reality*,” said Star Atlas co-founder & CRO, Pablo Quiroga.*

In partnership with Star Atlas, The Fabricant seized the opportunity to use technology to make the industry more sustainable while expanding its creative options in unlimited new ways.

One of The Fabricant’s key tenets is to vastly reduce fashion’s impact on the planet’s resources and the natural world through digital garments, making it sustainable by its very nature.

As a creative frontier and an emerging industry, the digital fashion environment opens up new avenues for all stakeholders in the ecosystem.

> “The Fabricant’s mission has always been about exploring ways to express ourselves in non-physical worlds, building new economies and transforming industries. It aligns perfectly with everything that Star Atlas is building as a metaverse gaming experience, where its creating an extraordinary universe for its citizens and redefining possibilities in the digital space. The Fabricant is committed to populating the Star Atlas ecosystem with inspiring garments so its citizens can curate their unique identities as they roam its worlds and participate in experiences. The collaboration is one to watch and an exciting step in the metaverse that will transform perceptions of what is possible for fashion in the gaming environment. Expect collections for its various factions of pilots, miners, or simply fans who want to have an individual look. Star Atlas citizens can independently organize their own digital fashion shows and runway events to create the fashion environment on their own terms. Both parties are committed to building an open, democratic and collaborative metaverse: Star Atlas is building a whole new world, and The Fabricant will be the first to populate that world with high-quality digital fashion. Make sure you keep watching, or even better, taking part. The most exciting stuff happens when we co-create,” *said Kerry Murphy, Founder of The Fabricant.*
