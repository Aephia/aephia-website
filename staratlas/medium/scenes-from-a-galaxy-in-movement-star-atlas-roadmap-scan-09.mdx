*Reports of the repercussions of the Council of Peace Assembly summoning across different factions and DACs in the Star Atlas Metaverse*

![Change is the only immutable truth. /// Metaverse in Light Speed Expansion /// Immersive Blockchain-Powered UE5 Experience](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/afb09881179738c4120d145e3f6ef93dab5b762ff5100eeb4f5decc8786c7399.png)

*“We are reaching a dangerous point. It seems that after one hundred years of peace, you have all forgotten the dread of war. I still remember, and that’s why I believe it’s imperative that we all stand down, and resolve our differences peacefully as equals under the banner of the Council of Peace Assembly. Otherwise, I don’t think any of the present factions will be here in the next century.” — A fragment of the Ustur CEO speech at the Council of Peace meeting that approved the COPA.*

**Council of Peace**

Ambassador Enantel Artonis had been in the political game for several decades. On his way to the top, he had dealt on a daily basis with the deadliest creatures in the galaxy — ambitious humans.

Forged by such challenges, he had learned how to read people. It was his favorite hobby and the reason he rose so high in the MUD diplomacy as to be number four in the intergalactic foreign minister hierarchy. After fifty minutes of the latest Council of Peace meeting, in which the CEO of ATMTA Inc. proposed the Council of Peace Assembly motion, he knew he would be in for a treat. Sure enough, for the first time in his career, he saw every single faction of the galaxy voting in unison.

He already knew the motion would be approved by the main factions since he was directly involved in the conversations, but what caused surprise to Enantel was the votes of the “heretics of ECOS”.

Enantel found it strange that their usual representative was now accompanied by a young girl flanked by a huge Tufa bodyguard. The girl was using an exosuit that reminded him of some sort of old extinct animal whose name eluded him…

“That must be the so-called druidess.” He thought to himself while remembering the growing popularity, even with some MUD rebel teenagers, of the ECOS engineer. “Oh, she is a rude one for sure,” the ambassador said to himself, as he saw that she wouldn’t stop staring at him, so he gave her a warm smile and a wave.

Diplomacy was an art, and someone without any trace of elegance was there, soiling the sacred temple of the craft, using her helmet to hide her face, and staring at the leader of the MUD diplomatic mission.

For the honor of humanity, this could not go unanswered.

As he started to prepare in his mind the right speech, a small frisson started across the room as the ECOS cast their vote. They supported COPA saying they were in favor of the motion, and even more, that they would halt all hostile operations on the frontiers of the different factions, including the MUD.

That was intriguing. The MUD looked at the ECOS with new interest. They knew that they didn’t need to vote in favor of the motion. Even more, they historically despised this kind of initiative. They were terrorists and as far as Enantel knew, they always behaved as such and respected only the fist, not the extended helping hand.

This shift in their posture could only mean one thing in Enantel’s mind: Fear.

“They are afraid. They know they are holding influence on MUD worlds for far too long and have been losing ground for our DACs every day… Well, I figure, if they give back what they stole, provide proportional compensation and swear fealty to the MUD as the only representative of humankind, we could surely work peace out, as humanity has bigger fish to catch.” The MUD ambassador thought to himself.

“Poor dear girl…” he whispered while preparing a whole new speech, full of compassion, understanding, and support for the ECOS initiative, as peace drew closer after their gesture.

Nevertheless, the Ambassador didn’t get this far by just assuming things, he would have someone look deeper into ECOS. He must learn what he can before reporting to her. “COPA will be the stage to learn their intentions. They might reveal something there. Better to get involved more closely.” The MUD ambassador let this last thought drift away as he rose to speak to the Council of Peace.

**Oxir — High-Risk Zone**

A spectrum of purple, pink, black, and blue flames leaped across the center of the enormous room with an open ceiling. There, a tribe anxiously waited for the darkness to conquer the sky, while the heat of the fire filled the silent thousand members with the necessary warmth to resist a cold night.

For a moment, there was nothing, and in the next there it was, Iris in full glory, revealing herself fully, without a trace of shadow. There was no doubt, the aspect of “The Child” would now govern the tribe. Instantly, the celebration began. Every individual started to dance, laugh and cry tears of joy. Music erupted and lavish foods were distributed as the flames at the center formed in the pattern of Iris’ child.

Smiling Oxirians, all with a tattoo of The Child on their backs, used drones to continually change the look and feel of the party and ensure everyone had access to the celebratory food and drink.

Odette, the High Matron of Oxir, was at the very center of the celebration. Even though she was already more than two centuries old, she was dancing with her children, greeting the guests, cracking jokes, and drinking to her heart’s content.

This appearance of The Child always had a huge impact on the tribe. It was one of the rarest aspects of their mother and served numerous purposes. It was a time to make new children for the tribe, celebrate victories and conquests, and strengthen community bonds.

Hence, the High Matron did everything in her power to reward her hard-working tribe. Every single one of them was a member of her own family, her children.

The party went through the night. A few hours into the celebration, a child of the Vinfid, visibly in a hurry, came closer to the High Matron and said: “Great Mother, I beg your forgiveness for interrupting at this moment, but what I need to tell you is of great importance to the tribe as a whole. Please grant me an audience.”

By the time he spoke the word ‘audience’, two children of the Avatena, who were in charge of the Matron’s security, had already subdued him. The older one said:

“This is an example of why the Vinfids are being punished by the mother in the sky. Be ashamed! We should have your life for this defiance of the child aspect.”

“I will accept whatever punishment the High Matron deems appropriate,” the Vinfid said without lifting his head from the ground. “But the security of the tribe might be at stake.”

Before either of the two Avatena could speak, the High Matron of Oxir gently touched their wrists, saying “My, my. Let me hear what my dear child has to say. You should be nice to your brother, right?” The pair immediately released their grasp on the Vinfid and stood completely still. Odette lifted her child and asked him to accompany her to the audience room, smiling all the while.

There, the Vinfid told tales of secrets and death, hopes and dreams, and one word was often used:

COPA.

After the report, the Matron of the Seekers was also summoned to the audience room. There, totems of all the aspects watched over the present, and the augurs were summoned to guide the children of Iris.

After the rituals were done, the High Matron thanked the child of Vinfid for his service and gave him new orders to execute, which he accepted with a nod and left.

The High Matron then came back to the celebration with her children, and they ate, laughed, played, and enjoyed each other until Iris left the sky.

**Ustur diplomatic corps returning to their home system after the Council of Peace Meeting -**

Captain Shaol.doer luck was finally changing.

“Finally, excitement!” The ustur celebrated in silence as he coordinated the fleet escorting the ustur diplomatic corps back home after the Council of Peace meeting.

The ustur felt as if he had been in the freezer of the ustur military. It had been quite a while since his last promotion to captain, and his daily routine consisted of patrolling the ustur system with his Opod to learn if there was an imminent threat.

But there was none, not a single time.

For almost half a year, he was there, everyday, doing the same thing. He would refuel, buy food, get some toolkit and ammo, and deliver those supplies here and there across the “safe zone”, which was indeed very safe.

This was all honest work, for sure, and the pay was not bad. He got his daily 69,51 daily atlas without trouble most of the time. Once in a while, the payment network was delayed a bit but that was no big deal. He understood that new technology had its issues, so he cut the guys some slack.

Nevertheless, there he was, commanding his own Vzus Ballad and escorting some of the highest-profile members of the ustur faction. The summoning for this mission came as a surprise, for sure, but he didn’t question the orders to be stationed for half a year doing patrol work. He surely wouldn’t think twice when it came to his superior’s wisdom in sending him out on this mission.

To be honest, Shaol found it a little strange that he was commanding a Ballad. He never piloted a large ship before, much less, a capital one. It was splendid in every single manner and the ustur was happy exploring it.

Even though he didn’t have actual experience, he had more than enough theoretical knowledge to cover up for that! He was an enthusiast of the Vzus industry and knew nearly everything there was to know about the Ballad, especially the two commander-size hardpoint weapons that this beauty had.

Surely no enemies would try their luck against them while captain Shaol was in command of a Ballad. He would erase any enemies before they would even be able to introduce themselves!

“Haha, this was awesome! Maybe I will be promoted after this mission and I will be able to keep the Ballad?” The ustur was now lost in dreams of glory and honor.

“Sir? Eh hmm… Just to report that we have finally reached the high-risk zone. Nothing worth mentioning appeared on the radar sir. Things appear to be quite secure for now.” A young junior scanner came to report.

The Ustur regained his composure: “Oh thank you…?” the ustur asked while waiting for the introduction of the crew member. “Colan, sir. Colan.bod. It’s an honor to serve under an experienced general like you, sir. It’s my first mission, but I will do my best!”

Shaol was stunned for a moment, but he deduced that the scanner was just nervous about his first mission and got confused. Usually, it would call for a correction, but the ustur captain liked the sound of general, so he would let it slide for now.

“Please, address the diplomats, tell them that we are having dinner at my quarters today. That will be all, Colan.bod.” Shaol casually said, while turning back to the space in front of his chair in the captain’s seat.

“At once, general.” The younger scanner immediately left.

“This is going to be a good journey,” the ustur said to no one in particular while watching the void of space, where he saw beautiful lights forming in the distance. He then added almost as a whisper: “General, huh?”

**ECOS Headquarters on the Council of Peace**

“Why bring me to that damn meeting Brikda?! Urhhh… it took me everything to control myself from terraforming the face of that cheeky MUD! Did you see that sarcastic smile?! He even waved to me, Brikda! He waved!!”

“We should totally kick his ass, like, right now!” I shouted.

Brikda solemnly ignored me as I stormed in circles, lashing out at the air in our beautiful quarters inside the Council of Peace while she examined some files on her suit A.I. which made me even madder.

“The worst part was that last cynical speech,” I added sitting by her side on the luxurious white couch. “The MUDs have been systematically targeting us in the past year, trying to undercut our supply chains, bribing planet authorities to cut their ties with us, and expanding their enterprises into our territories, yet they come talk about how proud they are that we are finally seeing reason and giving hope for peace!” I rambled.

“I swear as soon as we co– humph!.” Before I could even finish the sentence, Brikda suddenly dropped what she was reading and put her hand, bigger than my head, over my mouth, adding:

“Let’s have a walk in the garden, Druidess?” Brikda turned her back to me, walking in the direction of the corridor that took us out of our quarter. “I thought about biting her ‘hand’, but hard lessons from my childhood taught me there wasn’t much that I could do against the Tufa rocky body, so I didn’t have many alternatives but to angrily comply.

We ended up walking through the lavish central hall of the Council of Peace headquarters. There were many statues and holograms depicting the ‘many great deeds’ of the main factions of the galaxy, and how they heroically built up ‘peace’ and the current golden age of the galaxy.

I had to control myself not to throw up on the statues, especially upon reading the poem of the Peacebringers Archive:

“At dawn, they laid their souls to rest, battle scars long washed away. Chains of metal, flesh, and bone at last broken, turned to dust today. Ships and shields were shattered. Worlds were torn asunder. Yet in their darkest hour, their cry of peace triumphed over thunder. -To Honorable Leaders Armi.eldr, Bekalu, and Charon, signatories of the Galactic Peace Treaty. Passed away on the day of the fiftieth anniversary of the treaty’s signing.

Don’t get me wrong, diary, I love a good piece of poetry. I even wrote some, and maybe I will share one day, but it sickens me to see how the three big factions think that the galaxy is all about them and their DACs!

Billions, maybe even trillions, of lives were lost during the Convergence War. Most of those happened in deep space, where planets and systems served as the stage for the carnage. Whole planets were destroyed, turned into resources to keep the three factions’ war machines properly oiled.

Suddenly, when they realized that their own home systems were in danger, they started to write poetry and end the war. Leaving pure chaos in the medium zone and who knows what in deep space, filled now with pirates, monsters, and despair.

Makes me fricking sick. I’m glad that we exist to give a glimpse of hope to the galaxy.

Oh, maybe Brikda’s mission here is to showcase the ECOS path to the DACS during COPA? That would be awesome. Maybe we could get more DACs to support us, I thought to myself.

We finally reached the garden, and I have to hand it to the Council of Peace, they were able to make an ecosystem almost as good as we do on ECOS. Almost.

“So, Brikda,” I finally started asking after a couple of minutes as we were walking inside the heart of the garden dome. “It’s indeed a beautiful garden, but why did we come here?”

She looked around, maybe examining if we were alone, and after consulting her body A.I., she once more started in ‘mother’ mode:

“Alicia, your anger will be your undoing!!! Don’t you know that our room is probably totally wired by every single faction in the galaxy?! You can’t be smart only for creating stuff! That’s why you are here, to understand the real game, not to act like a spoiled child that gets frustrated upon the first provocation that someone throws your way. Focus.” Brikda said, half-mad, half preoccupied.

“Remember, Alicia, 90% of those present at the Assembly see ECOS as terrorists and would destroy us without as much as a blink. You, more than anyone, know that we need to stall. We desperately need the time to finish our creation.” She had the most worried look a Tufa could muster.

“You are right, Brikda. I’m sorry. I let my anger get the best of me when I see so much injustice and evil reunited. But you are right. We have missions to complete here.”

“We do indeed,” she replied. A very important one was just issued though. We are to meet the CEO of ATMTA. He is requesting our presence directly.”

“Brikda… do you think he knows?” I said almost in a whisper.

“I don’t think so, he wouldn’t let this be if he did. Nevertheless, we need to keep going. It’s not proper to let him wait, and he probably wants to share one of his engineering breakthroughs, or something like that, in hopes of getting your reaction and some valuable learning. Maybe we can profit from this conversation.”

I nodded, and as we started walking. Brikda suddenly stopped and said:

“What’s rule number one while on the Council of Peace territory, Alicia?”

“Never take my helmet,” I said seriously.

“That’s my girl. Let’s go.” She said, resuming the walk while giving me a rocky smile.

**Busan Industries**

Arabella was excited about the latest announcement of the Council of Peace Assembly.

Her ascension through the ranks of Busan has been closely tied with her success in prospecting new markets for their ships. (She even managed to sell some to Pearce maxi’s!) COPA seemed like an awesome place to personally get in touch with leaders of different DACs who had been investing good atlas into arming themselves.

In fact, everyone in the galaxy seemed to be accumulating ships, especially fighters, which was great for business and for Arabella especially, since she could certainly expect a nice bonus at the end of the year. She managed to make an exceptional deal with a new DAC that was mostly based on the high-risk zone. They wanted secrecy like many enterprises did those days, and for the Atlas they paid, Arabella certainly didn’t mind even erasing her memories after she sent them thousands of fighters.

This sale came at a great time. Being a Sogmian female Busan executive was challenging. Arabella had to outperform many heirs of old and powerful families of the consortium who ruled the company with almost absolute authority, deferring only to the very leadership of the ONI.

She was proud to have reached where she did with only her wits and the labor of her hands, and she would keep doing everything in her power to become CEO of Busan. COPA was her showcase.

If she managed to get the upper hand from the different manufacturers that would be attending the event, she would be that much closer to being appointed to the board of directors, and from there only a few steps were left until becoming the leader of Busan.

Arabella smiled while crossing space in her personal Maiden Heart and escorting the fleet back to the headquarters of Busan. She had much to prepare: favors to ask, meetings to schedule, ships to order, and deals to close.

She anxiously waited for COPA.

**Jorvik Raiding Party — High-Risk Zone**

“Good Morning Captain! Another day, another raid, right?” The Jorvik pirate greeted his captain with his usual compliment.

“Not today, unfortunately, lad. We have an announcement to make. Gather the crew on my deck now, Mister Peeple.doer.” The Captain issued his order and turned back to watch the horizon of the wild world that his crew had stopped by to resupply.

It had been a very successful campaign thus far, he thought, while smoothing the hull of the Jod Asteris they had managed to “acquire” last month. After Mr.Sbugolz suddenly vanished, he had managed to get some good spoils in his territory. One punaab’s problem is another man’s fortune, right?

He liked that old rat though. Hopefully, he was alive somewhere.

As his crew gathered around Captain Arxthrides, he smiled and started:

“Ladies and gentlemen, it’s been a most prolific, and very entertaining campaign for us lately, aye? But now… circumstances have changed.” The pirate said while trying to light a big cigar.

After a few tries, he finally got it lit and continued his speech.

“His Highness, the defender of freedom, lord of space, and first Jorvik, the Pirate King, has summoned us and every fleet back home. We are to be stationed there and await further instructions.”

Fifty voices started talking at the same time. Every member of Arxthrides fleet began debating, giving opinions, and asking questions of fellow crewmembers when one voice raised above the noisy crowd.

“Does this mean no plundering until further notice?” A turret gunner asked.

“Indeed, lad. The king was very explicit about ceasing all hostile actions unless on necessary and proportional self-defense until additional orders arrive.” The captain replied in a somber tone, already suffering from the lack of action that would be seen in the following days.

“What if we simply ignore the calling? We are making a fortune here with the boom of trading through this supply route! If we kept this level of activity we would all be rich in no time!” A very lively tractor beam operator said while looking to the sides to see the support of his proposition among fellow crew members.

The silence was sepulchral as every crew member stopped talking and started moving away from the beam operator.

A wide circle formed around the lad, opening a path to the captain.

Mister Peeple.doer, first officer of the fleet, hurried to the captain’s side and said in a very low voice: “Forgive him, Captain. He is young, dumb, and new. He was made a member on the latest raid and didn’t know better, I will whack his skull until his brain gets back into position.”

Arxthrides’ face showed only discontent. He wasn’t particularly happy to do what he is going to do, but there were just a few values that were simply unnegotiable for a Jorvik and the boy had just trampled on the most important: loyalty to Jorvik.

This principle derived into a single rule, loyalty to the Pirate King, as he was the manifestation of the Jorvik ideal. Every single Jorvik in the galaxy belonged to the Pirate King crew. His orders were more compelling than gravity itself, and like gravity, captains of every Jorvik fleet needed to make their crew always remember its weight.

He passed by Mister Peeble.doer, putting his hand over his metallic shoulder, while not leaving his gaze from the tractor beam operator for a second. “He is indeed only a boy”, the captain confirmed after confirming the shaking lad up close.

“What’s your name, boy?” The captain asked.

“Mer.. Merxizs, captain.” He replied.

The captain started: “Would you defy an order that came directly from me, Mister Merxizs? “Would you ignore the love and care of the one who gives you shelter, purpose, and fortune?”

“N-oo Captain”, Merxizs said, visibly scared.

“So why would you ignore, then, the orders of the one who first stood against injustice, and gave us all a place to be, and exist, in the way that we want? And for what? Some Atlas? For a ship? Is that what holds value for you, Mister Merxizs?

“No captain, I’m sorry. I truly am! I didn’t think straight.” Merxizs said, almost crying.

Arxthrides hugged the boy, his enormous body dwarfing Merxizs.

“Even though this was indeed a hideous crime, Mister Peeble.doer appealed on your behalf, Mister Merxizs. He knows of my soft heart, and pledged for mercy on your… narrow-mindedness if we can say it like that.”

He stopped hugging the boy and continued: “Nah.. you are all my children, and as a loving father I show compassion and love, always.” The captain said expressionless, and the beam operator’s face opened a wide smile of relief.

“Yet, it is also a father’s duty to teach his children long, lasting lessons that will serve to build their values.” He then drew a small laser knife, and gave the command: “Hold him still on the table.”

Two enormous Sogmians grabbed Merxizs’ hand and put it over a table with his palm down, despite the boy’s best efforts to disengage.

The captain then started carving the Jorvik symbol, with his knife, on the boy’s hand. The only thing that could be heard in the Jod Aesteris was the ghastly screams of Merxizs, and the air was filled with the smell of burnt flesh.

As Arxthrides proceeded with his work, he said loudly: “You have repented from your sin, and paid your due. For that, as captain of this fleet and representative of the King himself, I absolve you from your crime. Let this symbol be forever a reminder of your allegiance to your crew and Jorvik.”

He then finished the mark and the Sogmians let the boy go. He had passed out from the pain and was carried by fellow crew members.

“Make sure he is treated, Mister Peeble.doer, and set the course of the fleet to home, we have a long journey ahead.

“It seems we gonna attend an Assembly, boys.”
