*As the galaxy converges to the Council of Peace to address the summoning of ATMTA for the #426LIVE event. One being in particular watches the unfolding of a new galactic order with interest.*

![There is no absolute in the physical realm. We are all shades of colors. /// Metaverse in Light Speed Expansion /// Immersive Blockchain-Powered UE5 Experience.](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/614a8f838ae371344f704d0c09c6ad8e182d81320a617e3205fbc99e65eea402.png)

*“(…) So go now. Transcend your earthly existence and reach out to your true potential. The destiny of humanity is full of light and prosperity, and it awaits every person in the stars. There, you will find your long-awaited paradise. — A part of the Photoli Ahr speech to humanity, taken from his journal*

The assembly house of the Council of Peace parliament had never been so crowded, as delegations from every place in the galaxy sent their envoys to hear the ATMTA CEO’s speech. One could say that every relevant politician, aside from the leaders of the three factions, was there, waiting for the old Ustur.

A.I. drones from different news channels were busy flying around the halls of the assembly, trying to capture backstage conversations about what had been going on throughout the day. On the press room side, eager journalists kept a watchful gaze on everything, narrating every movement made by the many dignitaries that attended the event.

Oblivious to all the commotion, an individual, whose presence was masked by the latest light-reflection, tried to infiltrate the Council of Peace vaults.

As the delegations were still setting in, the secretary of the Council of Peace announced that the session was about to start, and the last conversations began to die out. Then, one minute later, a group of three strode through the hall: a big Sogmian on the right and a young, black long-haired human female, both wearing ATMTA Industries uniforms, flanking the leader of their company.

The CEO of ATMTA Industries walked solemnly through the last steps of the assembly hall, going towards the pulpit. He greeted the ceremony host and started his speech:

“Dear people of the galaxy,

I’m the current 42nd leader of ATMTA Industries, Chior.eldr. I stand before you today, as the successor of a grand legacy, born from those who wished to bring their dreams of a decentralized galaxy into reality. In its long history of successes and failures, hopes and deceptions, the stakes have never been so high in the battle for the very soul of our universe. I’d be betraying the valiant efforts of all those who came before me, should I shy away from the events that are unfolding now, before our very eyes.

One hundred years ago, after a war that threatened the very existence of sentient life in the galaxy, the reigning factions, seeing their own undoing by the machines of war that they unleashed in the stars, took a decisive step away from hostilities by creating the Council of Peace.

They created this very Council, delegating power to a multilateral entity that vowed to overlook the interests of every individual in the galaxy. This institution has worked tirelessly to reconstruct the foundations of the galaxy, creating supply chains, promoting integration between star systems, and settling disputes between DACS, groups, and faction

This new order brought an age of peace and prosperity for the MUD, ONI, and Ustur, mending the injuries caused by the Convergence War. Nevertheless, some scars have yet to be healed. Beyond the reach of the Council of Peace, a power vacuum among the planets that reside in what is called the high and medium risk zones of our galaxy was formed. This left those worlds subject to all sorts of circumstances and exploitations of regional and circumstantial powers that, in most cases, used those populations as a means to private ends.

Not only that, different DACs and groups have formed during the years of peace, most of them at the heart of the very civilizations that first started this Council, and they seek territories, riches, and glory in form of (…)”

The spy had a mission: Find restrict documents of the factions, especially during the years of the convergence war, he was especially commited to find a particular silver data cube, that was supposed to be on the war archive…That was what he was told, anyway, and his clan didn’t investigate those who became their clients.

He passed with ease through the first layer of security with his stealth gear, and reached to the lower levels of the building, which curiously, had their security movement detection systems disabled.

“(…) They didn’t live through the years of strife. They don’t know how ephemeral the beautiful lights of our galactic civilization are, and how the echoes of Convergence would extinguish them!

To keep this light burning — the light of peace, cooperation, and mutual development — is why we issued this call today.

We will present the biggest effort in the history of our company. Fruits of the labor of hundreds of believers who fought day and night against all odds to make their dreams an implacable reality, aimed to fill the hearts of the people with the hope of a prosperous and more inclusive future.

The first initiative that we will share today is the New Galactical Marketplace. A feature that hopes to entwine the whole galaxy economy, integrating every individual market in a fast universal network. It will allow individuals that were once segregated from the galaxy trading ecosystem to be able to acquire and sell goods and services in a cheap and efficient way by state of art software infrastructure.

We hope that by linking individuals and systems together, more prosperity will be generated through the many supply chains that our heroic freighters have created through the years.

Aside from participating in the economy, we want to drive members from every corner of the galaxy to join and colonize new frontiers in our vast space, allowing them to build the foundations of new civilizations in the many worlds of this cosmos. For this, we have created a second initiative called StarPath.

Baptized in the name of the legendary chain of warp gates that unite the different faction’s home worlds together, StarPath will use the new marketplace structure to bridge the citizens from any place in the galaxy to the Council of Peace welfare system, giving incentives to the captains that bravely transport those new pilgrims safely into our home worlds based on the faction system. (…)”

The spy knew he had to work fast, so he went as fast as he possibly could through the basement of ATMTA Industries, finally reaching the door of the vault, he only had a few minutes to go past the lock, which used the best technology in the galaxy to prevent invasion:

Memories.

A particular memory of an event was necessary to access the vault. Nevertheless, the spy came prepared, his employer had prepared that “key” to him, somehow, allowing him to enter the vault.

“(…) Finally, we have the last initiative of this day, which will be the next step of the greater purpose this Council of Peace serves. We of ATMTA Industries, after conversations with the leader of the factions of this galaxy, decided to give the first step towards a true decentralized galactic governance. We have created the DAO, a political governance platform which will allow members of our galaxy to have a voice on the decisions taken on the regional, faction, and galactic level.”

Hundreds of whispers could be heard across the enormous halls of the Council of Peace. Ambassadors, reporters, and general DACs members were all equally surprised, but before the whispers could turn into questioning and general conversation, the CEO of ATMTA Industries continued.

“The documentation of all the treaties, as well as all the details of how those transitions will take place, is now available for everyone in the Council of Peace chain archives. Nevertheless, I have one final surprise for you today.”

The conversation immediately died and Chior.eldr continued:

“To show our commitment to this new age, ATMTA Industries will proceed to move a sizable part of its forces to a special initiative to forward the Council of Peace mission in the middle-risk zone. All personnel of ATMTA Industries, including myself, will work under the Council of Peace’s guidance to further develop those regions and guarantee the observance of their citizen’s rights under the Council of Peace regulations.

So, as of now, ATMTA Industries is (…)”

After accessing the memory, the vault door opened, and the spy jumped into the vault, while scanning for the archives of the convergence war. He knew that he had little time before the inner vault detected an authorized person inside, so he screened through the files until he found the data referring to the convergence war.

As soon as he opened them, he saw the possibility of materializing a silver cube, and as soon as he interacted with it, the cube started to weigh on his hand. The spy smiled to himself, and when he was about to hurry away from the vault, a voice popped in his mind:

“Amusing”.

He instantaneously felt something hitting him in the back, and suddenly he couldn’t move. He felt weak as if his muscles simply stopped responding to him, to the point that he couldn’t muster the strength to move his head, and his conscience started to fade.

Another thought invaded the spy’s mind: “I’m sorry, my dear thief, but this item can’t leave the vaults of this Council. Now please, get some sleep.”

Before his conscience faded, he could hear the echoes of the voice of the Ustur CEO, ending his speech, and he saw a bright light, reflecting his attacker’s image on the pristine floor of the Council of Peace vaults.

“Photoli… I should have figured…” he let a last thought go, before descending to profound slumber.
