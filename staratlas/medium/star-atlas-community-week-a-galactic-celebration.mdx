Star Atlas is renowned for its dynamic and dedicated community, a group that stands as a pinnacle within the web3 gaming ecosystem. The citizens of the Galia expanse have been honored consecutively for two years with the esteemed Best Community Award in web3 Gaming.

Their unwavering commitment has been instrumental in the evolution of Star Atlas, which is evident through continuous feedback across various community channels and the creation of exceptional content, tools, and projects under the Star Atlas IP Build Program.

In recognition of this fervent enthusiasm, Star Atlas is delighted to host a five-day festivity to take in the Star Atlas community’s official [Discord](https://discord.gg/staratlas) channel, scheduled from February 26th to March 1st. These events are tailored to engage and entertain our players and their Decentralized Autonomous Corporations (DACs).

Also, a unique reward awaits those who participate in all the events of Community Week!

The exclusive Atlas Brew Badge will be awarded to all players who manage 100% attendance at all the events of the Community Week. In order to do that, make sure to pay attention to the exclusive codes we will be handing out, and use them on the Never Alone platform.
