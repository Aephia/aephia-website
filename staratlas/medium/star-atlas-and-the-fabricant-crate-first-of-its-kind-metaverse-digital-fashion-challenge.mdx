## **Winning Design Becomes an In-game NFT Asset**

[Star Atlas](https://staratlas.com/overview), the unique blockchain-driven metaverse and gaming experience, has partnered with world leading digital fashion house [The Fabricant](https://www.thefabricant.com/) to create a digital fashion design competition to dress one of its key in-game characters, belonging to the Ustur species.

The innovative design challenge asks the world’s 3D creators to let their imagination run free to design a garment aligned with the Ustur’s backstory and in-game narrative that compliments the spiritual interstellar being. Creators are encouraged to share their designs across social channels using the hashtag**#usturchallenge**.

The winning creation will be selected by both The Fabricant and Star Atlas teams to become a NFT asset within the game when it launches, allowing utility to digitally dress the character during gameplay or to be collected and traded by gamers.
