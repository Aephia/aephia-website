*Whether it’s chic couture or heavy torpedoes, the builders in the Star Atlas metaverse design and produce items to match the needs of every individual across the galaxy.*

![Star Atlas Builder-oriented In-game Mechanics /// In-Game Player-owned Assets /// Deep Space Metaverse Experience](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/3dfa7cabebee430dc13191bd49b8b6cdb897549dc079fd802d643a19f5fb53cf.jpeg)

You’re a member of the [Ustur](https://play.staratlas.com/leaderboards), a race of androids spawned from a multi-generational artificial intelligence that chose to express itself through different physical forms. Your body may be mechanical, but your mind has been shaped to articulate a unique personality. All Ustur exuberate their own unique identity, immerse in culture, appreciate fashion, and seek a higher purpose. Within the tension that courses through the entire galaxy, the Ustur are a faction of spiritually charged beings eager to form bonds with intelligent biological life.

In Star Atlas, intergalactic peace is delicately balanced between the human MUD alliance, the ONI aliens, and the sentient Ustur androids. Naturally, conflict flares up, but there are peaceful, even relaxing, paths for anyone who wants to enjoy the many sights and surprises that the galaxy has to offer.

Your Ustur lineage is a work of art where form and function mingle — the apex of artificial creation. Whereas you are surrounded by beings who engage in armed conflict and territorial struggle, your goal is to build. Every world needs its architects, inventors, and artisans, no matter how intense the rivalry and strife become.

## **Builders are the Innovative Power of Star Atlas**

The builders of Star Atlas produce goods and improve technology. You will work and trade with extractors and refiners who supply natural resources — all represented by NFTs — for your R&D and production processes that take place on [available land parcels](https://medium.com/star-atlas/star-atlas-in-game-land-landowner-63f9bd789027). Depending on how you calibrate your skills, you may improve your crafting speed, elevate recipe potency, or reduce resource wastage. Mixing and matching these traits will give you an edge while you hone your specialization.

Whether you’re crafting new goods and technologies or producing structures for the denizens of Star Atlas, you’ll need ATLAS, the main [in-game currency](https://staratlas.com/economics-paper.pdf). Since everything you make is represented by an NFT, your creations can be traded for ATLAS or other in-game items too.

Even though new items also drop for players who complete missions and quests, builders are relied upon as the true inventors and planners of Star Atlas. When factions settle new worlds, it’s up to you to create the structures and technologies that transform a minor outpost into a thriving port. Or you can design buffs for other individuals in the Star Atlas universe — miners, combatants, explorers, the future leaders of your faction. All of your creations can be sold in the [Intergalactic Marketplace](https://play.staratlas.com/market) for ATLAS, and builders can optimize yield by formulating a specialty and working closely with others who will benefit from your talents.

This is a path for anyone who wants to leave a permanent imprint on Star Atlas and shape the physical contours of their faction and beyond, including the inner abilities of their allies. As a builder, you’re someone who doesn’t need to throw all your time and energy into Star Atlas, but can still enjoy the process of raising a world in the void of space.

## **Adding Social Value to Star Atlas’ Economy**

Every frontier town needs its watering hole. After lengthy, risky deployments in deep, dark space, captains and crew members need a place to kick back, maybe even let loose a little after a long, successful deep space mission. They’ll mourn friends lost in territorial skirmishes and factional battles. They’ll celebrate with anyone who pulled in a major haul or was first past the finish line in a ship race.

*You name it Bar Aria.*

This time, your R&D skills are put toward making Bar Aria a truly unique place. You source rare minerals from your extractor and refiner contacts to sculpt stylish architectural elements. You have a land parcel in an up-and-coming transit port, secured as compensation for supplying your faction with a fleet of [BYOS Packlites](https://play.staratlas.com/market/BeqGJwPnRb3fJwhSrfhzgUYKqegUtGtvXajTYzEpgGYr). This is where you build Aria. Your faction offers a monthly payment of ATLAS to use your premises for mission briefings and community-building campaigns.

With the [POLIS](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/star-atlas-polis/) that you collected by completing in-game missions and being an active player in Star Atlas, you have a vote to shape political, defense, and economic policies within your region — your DAO.

Bar Aria is a place where alliances are forged over strong spirits, grudges are settled, and secrets are whispered and traded. You’ll be at the heart of it all, part diplomat, part entertainer, fully aware of what might happen next in Star Atlas. Bar Aria is your own corner of the intergalactic metaverse — after all, you have the token to prove it.
