Star Atlas has entered the next level of manifesting the future with the Blond:ish and Jason Silva meta-poster debut. This is the first of fourteen NFT meta-posters in the [ReBirth: Genesis of a Metaverse](https://play.staratlas.com/rebirth) series of next-gen experiences. Featuring augmented reality, ambient music and AAA graphics, the inaugural NFT offers an insight into the galactic metaverse, blurring the lines between the real and the virtual.

Vivie-Ann Bakos, better known as [Blond:ish](https://blond-ish.onuniverse.com/), a sound artist specializing in house and techno music. Her work has been inspiring and fueling creative tour de force Burning Man along with dozens of music venues worldwide. As a grand gesture to the Star Atlas metaverse, Blond:ish contributed the dreamy, slow soundscape to this week’s NFT. The ethereal vibe of her musical contribution sets the scene for the genesis moment of Star Atlas, the rebirth of the universe as we know it into an interactive and collaborative metaverse.

Alongside [Jason Silva](https://www.thisisjasonsilva.com/), the storyteller, futurist, and keynote speaker, the artistic duo worked together to create Star Atlas’s custom soundscape for the meta-poster series’ debut NFT, “Discovery of Iris.” Silva is well known for hosting brilliant and thought-provoking National Geographic’s BrainGames and his YouTube series, Shots of Awe, with over 100 million views. Through the transcendental artistic medium of the meta-poster, Atlassians can hear Silva’s voice reverberating through the orbit of planet Iris, an echoing of the genesis moment into the future where all things are possible.

The “Discovery of Iris” reveals the rogue planet Iris, dense with valuable materials and emanating mysterious energy that poster owners can now experience and explore through Star Atlas’s AR and multi-modal soundscape.

[The next meta-poster NFT will drop this Saturday, May 1st](https://play.staratlas.com/rebirth), and will be followed by one drop per week until July 24th. Prepare yourself for a journey deeper into the future and a metaverse reborn.
