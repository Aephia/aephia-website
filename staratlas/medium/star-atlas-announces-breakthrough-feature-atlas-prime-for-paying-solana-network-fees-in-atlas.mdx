*In-game currency ATLAS is now a base currency on Solana with ecosystem-wide adoption potential, allowing Star Atlas players to use it for paying network transaction fees and rent instead of SOL*

![Pay all your transactions with ATLAS!](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/b9f7815b5af7378a2d568465c2868e02954bcf65519dacf67115486b823da953.jpeg)

Star Atlas has created another game changer on Solana, enabling ecosystem users to pay their Solana transaction fees directly in ATLAS. The technological solution is called ATLAS Protocol for Real-time In-game Microtransaction Ecosystem (PRIME), powering direct ATLAS payments. It is also available to third parties, including community developers, wallets and infrastructure builders.

Atlas PRIME simplifies the lives of its users who from now on require holding only one utility token: ATLAS. It enables the establishment of true simultaneous play-and-earn and replaces the need for signing every transaction with Solana through exclusive use of ATLAS, e.g. for movement and crafting in Star Atlas Golden Era (SAGE) game modules.

*Michael Wagner, Co-founder of Star Atlas and CEO of ATMTA, Inc., said:*

*“Atlas PRIME adds another key pillar to the long-term sustainability and self-sovereignty of the circular Star Atlas economy. This additional ATLAS token utility is another step in bringing power to the people, and enables the onboarding of the worldwide player base.”*

With Atlas PRIME, users retain full control over their actions. Atlas PRIME is being released as a pre-enabled facultative feature, and can be turned on or off by the user.

The first Star Atlas feature to include Atlas PRIME functionality is the upcoming SAGE Labs game module. Atlas PRIME also makes it possible for Unreal Engine 5 game players to only use one currency, ATLAS, significantly lowering friction and removing a major game adoption barrier.

All Star Atlas products and services are slated for future implementation of the direct ATLAS payment functionality, and will receive it upon the update of a given product’s Star Atlas Account program.

**How it Works**

When users pay transaction fees in ATLAS, Atlas PRIME covers the SOL on their behalf. ATLAS is not converting directly at market rate, but is tied to it.

There is a fee associated with the ATLAS-SOL exchange rate, which is set by ATMTA and represents a source of revenue for the studio. The initial exchange rate fee is 115% ATLAS for 100% of a SOL equivalent amount. The 15% margin is determined based on significant risk associated with holding volatility currencies, including a liquidity risk for ATLAS, and covering the infrastructure costs for the service. Rates may change in the future.

For developers to be able to use Atlas PRIME in their third party app, they will need the bindings and the endpoint information, available at [build.staratlas.com](https://build.staratlas.com/?utm_medium=medium&utm_campaign=G23B).

In future Atlas PRIME feature expansions, users can look forward to more functionality, including enabling auto-sign on wallets, allowing for multiple simultaneous levels of security for their assets and various wallet actions. This will allow users to safely play the game with a game session hot wallet protected through a security configuration via Star Atlas Accounts.
