![Moments in Galia, Immortalized By Your Digital Lens /// Worldwide Community Art Contest /// We Are Star Atlas](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/183511dfbf16f1bd296bae392f8f5390edf4fca3290b3b83305aec067c35eeea.png)

Galactic Explorers!

Another legendary worldwide community challenge is about to begin. This time, you will let the photographer that lives within you capture the most beautiful angles of the Galia Expanse and compete for your spot over our universe hall of fame, entitling your work to be featured on the Star Atlas Galactic Marketplace, where it can be sold to art connoisseurs from all corners of the known space.

Excited? Let us walk you through how this is going to work.

Starting on July 14th, 2023, we will give our Galactic Explorers a specific theme that participants must do their best to capture using the photo mode tools available in the Star Atlas Pre-Alpha Showroom.

Each theme will be announced on [Star Atlas Twitter](https://twitter.com/staratlas) and through our community’s Discord announcement channel, lasting for four weeks. In the fifth week, four Finalists will be selected from submissions presented during the eligible period. It’s important to note that the odds of winning also depend on the number of entries submitted.

Both the finalists and the final grand winner will be selected by a combination of popular vote from the Star Atlas community and a panel of judges selected by the Sponsor. Each of the community votes, and the panel vote will account for 50% of the total vote. The panel of judges selected by the Sponsor will judge Entries based on their determination of (1) creativity, (2) originality, (3) ability to inspire, and (4) photo composition.

Finally, should you manage to win this prestigious event, you will be entitled to a unique prize. Your winning photo is going to be made into a poster, usable in Star Atlas Pre-Alpha Showroom, but also open to be negotiated in the Star Atlas Galactic Marketplace.

Needless to say, this is a great honor, as your work will live forever in the Solana blockchain and in Star Atlas history.

If you have any questions at all about this grand event, make sure to see the following video and read the detailed rule list below or reach out to us on our social media or Discord.

We wish you the best of luck, hoping the cosmic currents inspire you in your shots!
