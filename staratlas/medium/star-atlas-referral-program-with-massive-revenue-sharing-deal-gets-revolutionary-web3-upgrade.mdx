*Starting on September 20th, Starpath, the first truly web3 recruitment system, brings a generous 10% referral discount for new users, and gives referrers a 25% share of revenue from primary sales as well as secondary sale fees.*

![The Starpath opens tomorrow.](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/2236527f7687d8793a96767a6b50c37e2e7c6c6a4dda0eed72f70e67ce47db6b.jpeg)

Star Atlas has partnered with Buddy Link to power its next-gen Starpath reward program with a revolutionary product that facilitates on-chain referrals in Star Atlas for any user on Solana. It is the first-ever solution to enable on-chain referrals, ensuring transparency, security, and trust within the referral process.

The Starpath program rewards users for their contributions, sharing the success of Star Atlas with the entire worldwide community. This mutually beneficial relationship rewards those helping build the ecosystem, incentivizing user participation and project growth. The high reward system creates a web3 ecosystem that thrives not only on excellence in design and technology but also on the strength of the community that supports it. The scalable reward program also gives the many private organizations and creators within Star Atlas another way of supporting and expanding their operations.

This groundbreaking technology seamlessly integrates with Star Atlas on-chain programs, making it simple to deliver new users instant benefits with an individually tailored gaming experience, as well providing the Starpath program participants with transparent revenue sharing.

Starpath users reap the benefits of successfully promoting Star Atlas whenever the recipients of their referrals complete a primary or secondary (peer-to-peer) purchase in the [Galactic Marketplace](https://play.staratlas.com/market/?utm_medium=medium&utm_campaign=G23B).

The referrer is rewarded 25% of the net price amount in primary sales and 25% of the ATMTA share of the fee in secondary sales. The reward per each referred user stays at this level for 12 months following that user’s first purchase, followed by a 5% sales share during the duration of the Starpath program. The referred users receive 10% off primary sales in the Marketplace, usable for 90 days.

Users can sign up for the reward program via a link in their Player profile at Play.StarAtlas.com.

Michael Wagner, Co-founder of Star Atlas and CEO of ATMTA, Inc., said:

*“Starpath, powered by Buddy Link, shows the Star Atlas commitment to excellence and to continuously raising the bar for the entire gaming industry, as well as paving the best way for the web3 ecosystem.*

*It is the very first program in the world that allows Star Atlas to reward its players and ecosystem users, providing another way of giving power to the people.*

*He added: “Receiving a 25 percent share of purchases and our marketplace fee acts to empower the dreamers, creators and builders worldwide who want to participate in the creation of an open and decentralized world.”*

Aidan Neil, Co-founder of Buddy Link, commented:

*“As two pioneers of fully on-chain solutions, Buddy Link and Star Atlas share a common vision and value set of building a better, more community-focused web3 world. This forms our strong partnership, united in creating the best experiences for a connected and engaged web3-empowered society.”*

*He continued: “The Buddy SDK, imbued with Star Atlas know-how, integrates quickly and easily in the metaverse ecosystem. The platform offers a simple and intuitive interface that encourages users to explore, share, and learn about web3 projects, promoting growth and collaboration within the web3 community.”*

The Starpath program first went live [in July 2022](https://medium.com/star-atlas/starpath-the-official-star-atlas-referral-program-a08623af0c6a), and is now being powered by Buddy Link. Users of the legacy system are eligible to receive rewards proportional to their past success directly from Star Atlas and need to connect with Buddy Link via their player profile to participate in the new Buddy system.

**The New Starpath at a Glance**

Users sign up for Starpath at [Play.StarAtlas.com](https://play.staratlas.com/?utm_medium=medium&utm_campaign=G23B), where a referral link is generated in their Player Profile. A link in their profile also leads to the Buddy Link platform for monitoring referral activity.

A user who generates a link can no longer be referred but keeps any existing referral benefits of their own. Referral codes are randomly generated.

When a new user clicks on a referral link, they become linked to the original referrer, with any purchases counting as going to that referrer. Any subsequent referral links they click do not change the linked referrer. If the user clears their browser cache before making a first purchase, the referral source resets.

Referred users will see badges with discount on primary sales directly in the Galactic Marketplace.

Upon making a first purchase with their wallet, a referred user is permanently locked to the referrer.

When a user makes a purchase with a referral link, they automatically generate a link for giving out as a potential referral discount of their own.

New Starpath rewards can be claimed on the [Buddy Link platform](https://buddy.link/) leading from the player profile at StarAtlas.com.

The reward structure has a maturation curve that incentivizes early user action. For the referrer, the 25% commission on primary sales will last for 12 months and then decrease to 5% for the rest of the duration of the Starpath program. This incentive is per referee, not account wide. So every new referral starts a new 12 month timer for that referee’s purchases. The 10% discount for the referred user will expire after 90 days.

For participating users, Buddy Link will apply a special promotional platform fee of 0% for 90 days, and a low fee of 3% from then onward.

For the duration of the Golden Ticket event in SAGE Labs, every $500 USDC equivalent of value transacted will also award the referrer 1 Golden Ticket to enter in the $1.5 million promotion.

Dive into Star Atlas, refer your friends, and embark on a journey where every connection rewards you!
