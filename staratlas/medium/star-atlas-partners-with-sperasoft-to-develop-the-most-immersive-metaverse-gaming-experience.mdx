This full co-development partnership plans on taking the next-generation gaming experience to a higher level. With state-of-the-art blockchain, cinematic-quality graphics that respond in real-time, a vast multiplayer environment, and a decentralized finance system, Star Atlas has the potential to become one of the most beloved games ever.

> *“We’re thrilled to continue our expansion of onboarding Triple-A developer Sperasoft to this project to make the vision of a rich and vast metaverse a reality,” *said Michael Wagner, CEO of Star Atlas. *“We look forward to working closely with their talented team to leverage their extensive experience and design prowess to ensure Star Atlas maintains its position as a leading innovator across gaming and the metaverse.”*

The most interesting aspect of Star Atlas is that it aims to create a self-sovereign economy within the game using non-fungible tokens (NFTs), which allow players to purchase, use and fully own digital resources and tools such as spaceships. Replicating the tangible economy of the real world with assets that are fully digital, Star Atlas increases the risk and reward of space games.

Unreal Engine 5’s (UE5) Nanite graphic technology provides cinematic quality to the game visuals, making the players feel like they are actually in space. This technology provides an unparalleled graphics and gaming experience that will advance the whole field further with a giant leap. When it comes to the partnership between Sperasoft and Star Atlas, the possibilities are endless.

> *“Sperasoft has begun a partnership with Star Atlas to create the unique and creative gaming metaverse to push the envelope on space games,”* — said Denis Larkin, COO at Sperasoft. *“Our experts are incredibly excited to take the game to the next level. With the vision for Star Atlas, the sky’s the limit when it comes to how this game can grow.”*
