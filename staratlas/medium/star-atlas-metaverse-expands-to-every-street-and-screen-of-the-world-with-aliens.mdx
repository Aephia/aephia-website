Star Atlas is teleporting a dancing alien into the homes and streets around the world. With advanced distributed AR technology, anyone can now teleport an alien android to dance with to any location in the world at the touch of a button by visiting [ustur.staratlas.com](https://ustur.staratlas.com). The AR experience was released as part of the next growth phase of the Star Atlas metaverse, launched exclusively at the Bitcoin Conference, June 4th-5th 2021 in Miami, Florida.

Simply by clicking a link or scanning a QR code on their smartphone, the phone users can summon a sentient extraterrestrial through their web browser, [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/ar/2167347836897827/) or [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/fbcameraeffects/tryit/2167347836897827/) app at [ustur.staratlas.com/miami](https://ustur.staratlas.com/miami).

Star Atlas is also giving metaverse enthusiasts the ability to become aliens themselves by turning their faces to [Ustur](https://www.instagram.com/ar/476910276702323/) ([on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/ar/476910276702323/) or [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/fbcameraeffects/tryit/476910276702323/)) and [Photoli](https://www.instagram.com/ar/296551085508671/) ([on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/ar/296551085508671/) or [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/fbcameraeffects/tryit/296551085508671/)), two mysterious alien species. Using advanced Face Filter technology, anyone can now morph into a metaverse extraterrestrial or use it in their video call, stream or on Instagram/ Facebook story.

The alien, Ustur, is dancing and grooving to the tune produced by Jeff Peters, a songwriter and producer for top artists like Machine Gun Kelly, Steven Tyler, 24kGoldn, iann dior and Ty Dolla $ign. He has written and produced with the top names in songwriting, Grammy winners and Billboard top 10 writers. His extensive opus of songs and compositions have been used for the Academy Awards, the Voice, Good Morning America, HBO, the LEGO Ninjago Movie, and all major broadcast networks. As an accomplished arranger he orchestrated Nas’* Illmatic* for a 50 piece orchestra and arranged over 50 songs for the Hipster Orchestra. For Star Atlas, he composed the metaverse beat with a smooth digital vibe that befits an android alien, and giving the tune distinct character with a re-imagined take on the “first contact” if it were to happen in 2021.

To mark entering a new phase of its exponential growth at the Bitcoin Conference, Star Atlas is also releasing a Star Atlas Arcade Game, the project with roots in its [Star Atlas Arcade competition](https://github.com/staratlasmeta/star-atlas-arcade) for Solana ecosystem developers. The arcade game, running online on the Solana blockchain, is going to be playable online and at a venue during the Bitcoin conference in Miami, FL.

Star Atlas: Ustur and Photoli /// Digital Face Filter /// Cosmetic Alteration

**Meet the Aliens**

The dancing alien that also appears on one of the face filters belongs to the Ustur, a race of androids spawned by an advanced, multi-generational AI who sought to express themself through physicalized form. They are mechanical beings with a developed sense of identity, culture and fashion. Their anatomy articulates in a relatable way to organic substrate beings to convey demeanor and to emote. They enjoy establishing bonds with all intelligent life and satisfying higher spiritual exploration.

The second alien appearing on the face filters is a member of the Photoli, a race of highly advanced aliens of light. Their natural state is navigating the universe in the form of light energy. Their ability to maintain a corporeal form with amorphous anatomical shapes and halos conveys expressions to other species. During galactic explorations, they are known to be confused with deities by more primitive civilizations. One Photoli rogue scout in particular played a pivotal role in advancing humankind to the stars.
