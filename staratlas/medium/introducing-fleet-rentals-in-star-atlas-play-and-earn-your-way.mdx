The Star Atlas universe is home to a wide variety of user personas, ranging from the hardcore gamer to the financially savvy space-faring investor. Now, all those players will converge to cooperate in a new age of prosperity with the Star Atlas **Fleet Rental Program**.

Starting**March 5th**, galactic entrepreneurs will be able to generate automatic revenue in ATLAS by allowing active players to rent their idle fleets and actively play Star Atlas with minor upfront costs.

Whether you’re a fleet owner looking to generate revenue, a seasoned player wanting to expand your operations with high-level fleets, or even a curious captain interested in understanding what Star Atlas has to offer, this program makes it**seamless, secure, and fully automated** — all powered by blockchain technology.

## How Fleet Rentals Work

![](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/f39c28c55294758668bd3854af0b6612452027973d227928a1cfed4a2e044e5b.png)

At its core, the Fleet Rental system allows**Owners** to rent out their fleets to**Renters** in exchange for payment. This is done**on-chain** using smart contracts, ensuring security and automation for both parties — no middlemen and no counterparty risk — just a smooth, transparent transaction.

## For Renters: A Galaxy of Opportunities

The rental system opens the doors to uncountable possibilities to seize and leverage the valuable resources of the Star Atlas universe to your benefit. Whether you are representing a massive DAC with a complete supply chain, playing as a solo captain looking forward to expanding your operation, or even a completely new player who wants to get started in Star Atlas with minor upfront costs, the**Fleet Rental Program** opens the door of prosperity to you through many different paths!

Join us now to explore the many play styles and possibilities this new system offers.

## Mining Moguls: Build Your Mineral Empire

![](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/d4fcba926f089dbccae06282929a64de502f9fcbe97975573cbc43dda20befc6.jpeg)

The mining operations are the foundation of the Star Atlas ecosystem. Everything in the game requires resources, and using fleets to mine is one of the quickest ways to generate ATLAS.

Using the Fleet Rental Program, you can become a mining powerhouse even if you don’t own a single fleet. Even if you do own ships, you can take advantage of fleet rentals to leverage your operation to a size many times greater than your existing scale.

For example, to acquire a fleet of**16 Armstrong Tips** to mine Hydrogen, you would expend 4.5k USDC in current market costs for the ships, and this fleet is able to generate**16,272,872 units of Hydrogen a day**, worth in the current on-chain market value of 5,544 ATLAS in net profits a day or 8.87 USDC.

Instead of using the capital to acquire fleets, you can use it to rent them, increase the scale of your operations, and use the profits to expand your presence in Galia (or whatever else your heart desires). Going back on our example, why mine with a single fleet if you can have 10 fleets acquiring 162M of Hydrogen units daily? Or mine many different types of resources at once? The possibilities are endless!

The ship owners will be delighted to rent their fleet to you for the fees, and you will surely be happy to put them to good use! Everybody wins!

### **Starborne Logistics: How to Leverage the Galactic Trade Network**

![](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/257aed4c4c0ac32723066d320a742cf6da55f3de17cd3cf946bb8435cbea5919.jpeg)

Another way to leverage fleet rentals is by focusing on the supply chain business. Fleet crewmembers need food to eat, fuel to warp, and ammunition to mine, which the galactic freighters provide.

Cargo space is very valuable in Star Atlas. No sector of the Galaxy is self-sufficient, and players must rely on other players to haul necessary items for their daily in-game operations.

The trick here is to watch the different sector marketplaces of your faction and find where you can acquire cheap goods (usually in the sectors they are produced) and haul them to where there is a demand.

Then, you rent fleets with a seizable cargo capacity and start hauling the items across the galaxy.

For example, as this article is written, there is an opportunity to**transport food** in the Ustur Faction. You can acquire food for 0.0011 ATLAS/unit in**Eol-Garadar (MRZ-23)** and sell instantly for 0.00185 ATLAS/unit in**Pavo Passage (MRZ-17).**

The opportunities are endless across the more than fifty sectors in the Star Atlas galaxy. If you pay attention, you will even find zones where some of the essential resources for operations are depleted, with demand being more significant than supply!

Leveraging the fleet rental system to build a robust logistical supply chain to supply the vast universe of Star Atlas with goods is another interesting path to prosperity!

### **The Supply Chain of Creation: Moving Crafters with Fleet Rentals**

![](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/908deafc9127e3d0bd2e38febe31dea022b3113fa5c23734f6ab6ac33ad9c79b.jpeg)

If mining is the Star Atlas economy’s foundation, crafting makes the galaxy move. Raw materials are undoubtedly necessary, but they require the hard work of crew members to become useful for players’ fleets and operations.

This mechanic creates many opportunities. Having your workers in the right place can increase operational efficiency by saving travel costs, acquiring cheaper products in the local markets, facilitating cargo hauling, and producing goods closer to demand zones.

Nevertheless, to seize this opportunity, you must possess fleets capable of accommodating your crew members, which is where the fleet rental system comes in.

If you need to pivot your workforce quickly to adapt to a change in the markets, or if you find a more desirable gameplay loop that requires the relocation of your operations, or even if a vital starbase is devoid of essential consumables and needs assistance, the fleet rental system will allow you to cover this logistical gap seamlessly and efficiently.

Once your crew is deployed, you can cancel the contract and move on!

### **Upcoming Opportunities: Defending or Assaulting Star Systems**

![](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/5db220c96b11cee42cce1d6b57fbc6561ee8b8e6eea9992ada6ec81e23a9222f.jpeg)

We are working on another exciting update for Star Atlas players: The introduction of**combat mechanics later this year**.

To provide a quick and early overview, this update will allow players to attack and defend star systems, acquiring resources from their defeated opponents.

This new dynamic will heavily impact rental opportunities, as players will be able to leverage other players’ fleets to launch raid parties in other factions’ star systems or even defend their homeworlds and friends by acquiring those fleets to enhance their power instantaneously.

Anything that can tip the scales of combat in Star Atlas will be of the utmost importance. Players who can strategically use the fleet rental system might be the key to protecting their faction’s borders or conquering enemy territory.

### **How to Get Started: Find a Fleet & Accept the Offer**

![](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/1a668d230dadf7438845bb349cb39c239c2b705c3a139c79f7fb48373cfced5e.jpeg)

The system is pretty straightforward:

- Once the system is live on March 5th, we will share the link to the**Fleet Rental Page.** Players will then be able to search the available fleet inventory for fleets that fit their needs.
- Once you have found the right fleet, click the rent button. This will prompt you to pay the**rental deposit**, and then the fleet will be immediately**assigned to you** on SAGE.
- On a separate note, if you do not already have consumable resources in the game (food, fuel, ammunition, and toolkits), you should search for fleets that possess a balance of those items, as they will be needed to operate in Galia!

Now, you just have to focus on making the most of that fleet for the duration of the contract. No extra actions are required from your side since the ship owner payments are**automated** at scheduled intervals.

### Flexible Playtime, Clear Rules & Easy Exit

![](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/da9832cf1bbe611afab32cfeb650322a9c0dc81c8a8ddcb68995fbbd7e0c053b.jpeg)

Our system also allows you to**cancel the rental contract at any time** and get refunded for unused time. For instance, if you did not like the fleet you rented or simply won’t be able to play during that period, you can just cancel the contract on the**Fleet Rental Page** and get a refund for the unused rental period.

You will also not have to worry about returning the fleet. If the time expires or your deposited value cannot cover the rent contract, the fleet possession will be**automatically returned to the owner**.

## For Fleet Owners: Activate Fleets, Maximize Earnings

![](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/c5eb1c2369f229b4578369ac9a0009c54fdcef83173cecd60718dced73d0e0f6.jpeg)

Not everyone has the time or desire to manage fleets in active gameplay full-time. Nevertheless, with the introduction of the fleet rental program, you will become an entrepreneur in the ship marketplace, and there will be no more idle fleets!

The system allows you to set your fleets for rent for the price and duration you establish, and then works seamlessly to collect payment and guarantee lending security through on-chain contracts.

All you have to do is:

- Go to our [SAGE website](https://based.staratlas.com/), set up your account, and create a fleet using your ships and crew. The process is super simple: no registration is required, and you can complete it in a few clicks.
- Once it is live on**March 5th**, go to our**Fleet Rental Page** and choose your fleet**rental rate (**how much you charge for the entire rental), then assign the duration of the rental contract. The interface is super intuitive, and we are preparing a tutorial video for the release day later this month!

Once your contract is created, you then wait for an interested player to rent your fleet.

### A State-of-the-Art Smart Contract: How The Rental System Works

![](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/5dd8ba31330a280080d9656c830f5c546eee3b37d61ee1b57761edcafb9d49d5.jpeg)

The fleet rental system is a smart contract that allows the renter to access your fleets without giving them the property–**you maintain underlying ownership of your fleet at all times**. A renter can only use your fleet within the limits of SAGE. Even there, the renter is limited to in-game activities such as mining, searching for SDUs, or hauling cargo. They cannot disband your fleet, access your crewmembers, or withdraw those assets from the game.

Once the rental period ends or the renter cancels the contract*,*your fleet automatically returns to you**. The fleet will be automatically relisted on the rental platform with the same parameters unless you cancel or modify it. No actions are needed!**

### The Automated Earnings System

![](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/534109ab1d73e6cda9a387383b1d8bc9393c798a77811ea00caf3affdcba857c.jpeg)

Another interesting perk of our rental system is that it**automatically collects rent payments** at set intervals based on the duration of your rental period (hourly, daily, etc.). If the renter cancels early during the rental period, the system will automatically provide a proportional payment based on how long the renter used your assets.

This way, our system ensures that ship owners receive**their payments with minimal effort, are not at risk of security breaches, and enjoy full control over their fleet’s pricing and availability.**

### **Tips For the Fleet Owners**

![](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/632d8d1e134e6189966ce88d66a811d89c4e1824cd418ade71b556dfccc82d84.jpeg)

Last but not least, we also prepared a few tips to help our ship owners maximize their fleet’s utility in the Fleet Rental program.

**Design Attractive Fleets:** The most critical step for a shiplord is creating an efficient fleet. Try to have clear fleet configurations, such as keeping all ships within a specific specialization, such as mining, fighters, or freighters.

**Dock Your Fleet in a Relevant Location**: Fleet renters look forward to making the most of your fleets with the time they are given, so try to dock them in strategic starbases or your Faction Central Space Station to make them more attractive. No one wants to rent a fleet stranded in the middle of nowhere!

**Use Data Tools to support your decisions:** The Star Atlas community has many data tools that allow you to check the efficiency, revenue, consumption, and overall information on all in-game assets. Use tools like the [Aephia Dashboard** ](https://flipsidecrypto.xyz/Aephia/star-atlas---my-star-atlas-v2-GIPTPH)and [Eveeye operations](https://atlas.eveeye.com/?operations) tab to guide you on fleet pricing and potential. Also, if you have any doubts or want to trade points on SAGE mechanics, the Star Atlas community will gladly provide you with information and support on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/staratlas)!
