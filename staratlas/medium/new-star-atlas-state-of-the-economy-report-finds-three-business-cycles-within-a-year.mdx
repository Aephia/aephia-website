*The quarterly paper of record offers economic insight into the world’s fastest growing ecosystem of the gaming metaverse.*

![State of the Economy /// Insight Into Star Atlas Metaverse Economic Boom /// Quarterly Metaverse Paper of Record](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/660c0d0a1f90f86c423d848e0b5aa934d1fd0b4b11e93a15df1fb641de2a488c.png)

We have just released the latest edition of its “State of the Economy Report”. This report incorporates prior work on the ecosystem and economy into business cycle analysis by utilizing variables such as Atlas wages, net investment, labor force, and ATLAS/USD to describe the state of the economy.

The analysis employed through the lens of the business cycle modern theory allowed us to identify three full business cycles in the domestic Star Atlas economy over the course of 2022. The three recessionary periods are represented by the blue shading in the figure below.

By using this methodology, we are able to define critical indicators for data runners and macro researchers and create a panel dataset that is equivalent to country panel datasets maintained by the OECD and IMF.

We have also described all the academic references used in the articles, along with the methodology, so our most curious readers may understand the standards and definitions applied to create this work.

Aside from that, our economic team also prepared a list of the most important data highlights from the different areas of the Star Atlas economy, such as:

- Aggregate daily ATLAS wages for in-game activity increased by 1.02%.
- The average wage per ship increased by 6.73%.
- The aggregate employment rate per ship decreased by 5.03%.
- The size of the labor force contracted by 0.7%.
- Employed residents and citizens claimed 432.12 million ATLAS through in-game earnings.
