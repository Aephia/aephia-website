*The Council of Peace issued a special announcement in partnership with ATMTA Industries. The CEO of ATMTA published an open message outlining his plans for the progress and stability of the galaxy, summoning every person for a future public event detailing every step of the new order ATMTA was forwarding.*

![After the speech, celebrations erupted throughout the galaxy, with people anticipating the winds of change /// Metaverse in Light Speed Expansion /// Immersive Blockchain-Powered UE5 Experience.](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/f319be4507b5539ef7785dec56e685a402ed7192867587c138b3f625db21fabc.png)

*“Some people said they already knew what would happen after the CEO’s message. Don’t believe them. In hindsight, everyone can predict the future. Even the old Ustur couldn’t predict the chain of events that would be triggered then.” — A quote from The Punaab Whisper in the Echoes of Convergence article.*

After leaving the CEO’s room, I was dumbfounded. I looked at Brikda, and she looked back at me, and for the first time, we didn’t know what to say. It’s been weeks since COPA, and I finally understood what the CEO of ATMTA had been planning.

He wanted to change the entire status quo of the galaxy in one speech.

As he disclosed what he was going to do, everything made sense, and the worst part of it, aside from the feeling of being used as a cog in an enormous machine, is that it made sense. I liked his idea, and hell, maybe he’s right, and this is what we need to settle our differences once and for all.

Nevertheless, I still couldn’t figure out how the part of the plan I was most involved in fit into all of this. But perhaps, just like everything else, it would eventually coalesce.

If I’m being honest, I couldn’t help but be excited.

Brikda finally spoke, breaking me out of my thoughts: “If he is releasing all of that, he will need to take care now. He was already a target for half of the galaxy. Now everyone will be after him, one way or another, Alicia.” Brikda said in a somber tone.

“Yeah.. let’s see what he is going to do.” I replied.

*A few minutes later, at the ATMTA embassy inside the Council of Peace, everyone in the galaxy is awaiting a promised message from the CEO of ATMTA Industries.*

Good Morning, Afternoon, or Evening, my dear followers of the Punaab Whisper! Your intrepid reporter is here now at the ATMTA embassy doorstep, where a statement is about to be made public regarding what was described to the press as an invitation to the event that will change the galaxy forever.

Much is speculated about the nature of this event, as high-profile ATMTA representatives like the legendary Santiaac have been hinting in the company’s events such as the Atlas Brew that something big is coming soon.

We of the Punaab Whisper feel this is connected to the events of COPA and our gues- Oh wait, hold on, a hologram of the CEO of the ATMTA Industries just appeared here in front of the embassy doors, let us hear his message now.

“I would like to thank everyone for gathering here today.

The Council of Peace Assembly deeply inspired us of ATMTA. We saw the marvels produced by some of our galaxy’s leading decentralized autonomous organizations, representing the three major factions. So we figured we might as well disclose our plans for the universe’s development and the general relationships between every sentient being in our cosmos.

It’s our understanding that the current arrangement of power, focused on immense institutions that reign supreme over the destiny of billions of beings, doesn’t comprehend the complexity of the current galactic populations, especially the necessities of those that live far from the seats of power.

Nevertheless, some of those unsatisfied voices are also quietly humming dangerous tunes. They talk in private rooms about receiving their fair share of the many riches that our current age of cooperation has created and that power can’t be acquired, just conquered.

They are getting louder by the day, saying that war, while not ideal, would at least offer the hope of rearranging the power structure of the galaxy.

We at ATMTA are firmly against this view. I see many young faces in the crowd, and I deduce that most of you were born under the one hundred years of peace and prosperity we have had so far.

But that wasn’t always the case. I and others here lived through the years of strife over a century ago. We watched the death of many civilizations, crushed under a senseless machine of war that raged through the cosmos. We felt in our bodies the famine, hardship, shortages, and complete obliteration caused by the Convergence War.

The riches you are looking for will turn into dust as soon as the Treaty of Peace is annulled.

That’s why ATMTA Industries comes forward, in the best interest of peace, and will disclose our plans for our galaxy’s new, decentralized order.

First, we see that the populations of what is popularly called the Medium Risk Zone are in a very vulnerable position, suffering from the political chaos caused by the retreat of the factions to their home worlds after the Convergence War.

This power vacuum allowed for exploitation, misery, and overall chaos, for which everyone in a position of power is accountable. To help solve this situation, **ATMTA is starting several galactic initiatives**.

They have a shared ethos of integration through decentralization and will work on synergy to promote the changes we deem necessary in the galaxy.

We call it 426LIVE.

Project 426LIVE is a massive paradigm shift. The changes will take some time to implement as we fully negotiate with every affected party. Nevertheless, what ATMTA can assure you is that this galaxy will be, each day, one step closer to the decentralization of the decisions that affect the collective sentient beings of the universe.

The first and most significant steps of this journey will be done on the 21st of July when our partners and I will disclose those initiatives in detail.

As the saying goes, every 426 comes to an end.

Thank you for your time.”

This was the CEO of ATMTA Industries, and as you guys can see, the press around us is indeed brimming with questions, but the hologram of the CEO of ATMTA has already dispersed. However, this project 426LIVE reminds this reporter of something disclosed at the Council of Peace Assembly.

As the CEO’s message addressed several initiatives, perhaps we will have a massive launch soon?

It seems that now soon, time will tell.

This was the special report of the Punaab Whisper. As always, we thank you for your audience and will come back to you with more information as soon as it’s disclosed! As always, keep your eyes open and notifications on!
