Solana Season is in full effect!

![](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/ffbf108d5bede1fbeedd33e4fd7308eded5d2f075ae9660f074ae677dc3f9c8a.png)

On May 7th at 9 am PST (6am EDT), [Star Atlas](https://staratlas.com/) is launching a live NFT workshop on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/solanatv) as part of the [Solana Season Hackathon](https://solana.com/solanaszn).

With grand prizes and seed funding available to all registrants, and with regional prizes of up to $155,000, the interactive event features up to $1 million in prizes and seed funding. Projects will be evaluated on their technological merits by established figures from the crypto/blockchain industry.

> We are incredibly honored to take part in this very next-generation challenge for the brightest minds in the thriving Solana Ecosystem. We are especially grateful to the developers who will illuminate the metaverse of Star Atlas with their ideas and solutions and leave a lasting impact on the future of us all. Happy hacking!— [Michael Wagner](https://twitter.com/at_mwagner), Star Atlas Co founder and CEO

Star Atlas is supporting a 25k prize track for hackathon participants to build out their own game in the Star Atlas Arcade. Additionally, winners for the most innovative projects will gain exclusive access to the Star Atlas backstage, the engineering deck and collaboration on delivering the winner’s product in the upcoming Star Atlas Arcade.

To qualify, developers must enter their programs into the Star Atlas Arcade ([https://github.com/staratlasmeta/star-atlas-arcade](https://github.com/staratlasmeta/star-atlas-arcade)). Arcade prizes will be distributed among the top three projects chosen by judges which best overall showcase the use of the Solana protocol for gaming. In addition, there are cash awards available to projects which shine in particular categories.

The workshop will give participants the opportunity to earn [USDC-SPL](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-season#prizes) rewards for building new and innovative in-game assets and bring first-hand experience to building blockchain-based solutions with NFTs, such as the [ReBirth Meta-Poster series](https://staratlas.com/updates/introducing-rebirth-genesis-of-a-metaverse), and next-generation games via the Star Atlas Arcade.

The hackathon session will unfold as outlined in the [Star Atlas Arcade repository on Github](https://github.com/staratlasmeta/star-atlas-arcade):

1. Participants will build their project.
1. They will open a pull request against this repository.
1. Star Atlas will provide a simple way to integrate their webpage into staratlas.com and include any relevant environment variables or constraints required for the participants’ projects to run.

The Star Atlas NFT workshop has received more than 2,000 sign-ups so far and is sure to teleport Atlassians and Solana hackers into the future of blockchain-based MMO gameplay.
