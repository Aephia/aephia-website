Efforts include:

- Strategic Partnership
- Social Impact
- Real-World Utilization of NFTs

[Star Atlas](https://staratlas.com/), a space exploration strategy game and blockchain-driven virtual metaverse, has announced a partnership with [Yield Guild Games](https://yieldguild.io/) (YGG), a company revolutionizing the “play to earn” model in gaming. YGG’s mission is to gather gamers around the play-to-earn metaverse and invest in assets that help those players earn yield. Through the partnership, YGG will enable metaverse participants to lease NFTs on the in-game Star Atlas DeFi marketplace.

Star Atlas and YGG are closely aligned in terms of vision and mission. Together, they aim to aggregate gamers and enable novel in-game economies through the use and application of NFTs. In YGG’s “play-to-earn” model, players earn yield by operating, selling or leasing collectibles in-game. As NFTs, these items are uniquely distinguished and monetized based on the value ascribed to them. Players, no matter their location, can therefore generate income by operating and selling these leased in-game objects.

> “We’re taking all the ingredients of a remarkable AAA game — graphics powered by Unreal Engine 5, sub-second finality, and low transaction costs — and creating an epic metaverse never experienced before. With YGG, we’re going to be pushing the envelope with real-world, innovative NFT uses. In this groundbreaking model, NFTs will allow gamers all over the world to earn actual money,” said [Michael Wagner](https://twitter.com/at_mwagner), CFA, co-founder and CEO of Star Atlas.

> “Star Atlas and YGG have partnered because we truly complement each other’s strengths. YGG will provide access to burgeoning gaming communities based in the Philippines and throughout Asia, while Star Atlas will build the metaverse in which YGG guild members earn yield. Further, with plans to onboard tens of millions of players into their guild, YGG is playing a part in helping us scale on a massive, global scale and welcome gamers of all types into our metaverse,” said [Pablo Quiroga](https://twitter.com/pabloiquiroga), co-founder and COO.

Powered by [Solana](https://solana.com/) and [Serum](https://projectserum.com/), Star Atlas provides real money-making opportunities for metaverse gaming participants. Instead of playing prescribed roles to earn video game points which can then be exchanged for real-world currencies on grey markets, Star Atlas enables open-ended creative experiences that are monetizable across the metaverse via $ATLAS and NFTs.

This play-to-earn model offers benefits to both Atlassian gamers and the Star Atlas metaverse. Players feel a personal connection with the metaverse while creating unique in-game assets organically. In turn, the metaverse expands, offering new opportunities for other players to participate and build out their own monetizable experiences.
