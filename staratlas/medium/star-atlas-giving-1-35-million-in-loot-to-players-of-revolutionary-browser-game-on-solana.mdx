*Worldwide Golden Ticket event is the biggest Star Atlas reward campaign yet with players competing for a new reward pool of a minimum of $150,000 every week with a bonus $150,000 on the first week by crafting and discovering in-game golden tickets.*

Star Atlas is once again taking traditional gaming to the next level with revolutionary web3 technology, this time with bountiful player rewards in its [Golden Ticket](https://play.staratlas.com/market/GLDTKDYdSkdCzSC6fqRWqHZ5fUQGsm1CM4nMZnsCZNcX/?utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=G23B) event. This exclusive opportunity, part of the [Star Atlas Golden Era (SAGE) Labs](https://labs.staratlas.com/?utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=G23B) browser game on Solana, allows players to craft, trade, and win from a whopping loot pool of $1.35 million over an 8-week promotional period.

To participate, players can craft Golden Tickets by using all crafted in-game assets in a special crafting recipe within the SAGE Labs game. These tickets are unique Semi-Fungible Tokens (SFTs) that can be entered into a weekly loot drawing of $150,000. The first week offers an increased loot pool of $300,000, featuring an extra Commander class ship. The inaugural weekly drawing will happen on **November 3, 2023**, while the participants will be able to submit their golden tickets for this drawing**from October 27, 2023 onward**. Please follow the Star Atlas [Twitter](https://twitter.com/staratlas) and [Discord](https://discord.gg/staratlas) channels for details.

As player-owned in-game assets on Solana, Golden Tickets are not only the entry to massive rewards but are also tradable in the [Galactic Marketplace](https://play.staratlas.com/market/?utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=G23B). The Web3 native draw process, enabled through a Star Atlas partnership with [Hedgehog Markets](https://hedgehog.markets/), ensures a permissionless and fully secure system for players. To verify the authenticity of an asset in their wallet, players should always use the Play.StarAtlas.com website.

There are multiple ways of obtaining a Golden Ticket. In addition to crafting it or purchasing it in the Galactic Marketplace, players can earn golden tickets by referring users via the Starpath program or by participating in other promotional activities. For every $500 in transactions a Starpath user facilitates through referrals, it earns them an additional Golden Ticket.

> *“It has been precisely 69 years since Roald Dahl’s original story that threw every school hallway into a frenzy and made a generation of youngsters dream about a world of opportunity, enabled by amazing technology.*

> *Equally remarkable at unlocking limitless opportunity is the technology powering web3 revolution, which we’re celebrating for the next eight weeks with an homage to the brilliant and inspiring classic.”*

> - Michael Wagner, Co-founder of Star Atlas and CEO of ATMTA, Inc.

Golden Ticket rewards consist of a tiered loot table that contains a variety of loot ranging from top-tier rewards like Capital and Commander class ships, to CSS Land Plots, hundreds of XXS and S spaceships, and some exclusive, never-to-be-sold new ships.

Drawing highlights include weeks with 5.6 million ATLAS for one winner or 1 million ATLAS for five winners. We’re also introducing two new ships that are exclusive to SAGE Labs and the Golden Ticket event, the Fimbul Mamba Ex, and the Calico Maxhog multi-utility vehicle. Additionally, the Fimbul BYOS Butch, a new large fighter class ship, will also make a debut in the drawing.

The Golden Ticket event is designed to reward users who are committed to the Star Atlas ecosystem and provides an opportunity for players who spend time in SAGE Labs to win big.

In exchange for stress testing the real-world SAGE Labs game economy loop and other novel Star Atlas features, players obtain Golden Tickets and get a chance to win high-value loot.

The Golden Ticket event also advances the in-game lore for SAGE. The temporary truce on the medium zone is just the calm before the storm as the various groups of the galaxy prepare their fleets for what seems to be an impending war. Yet, there are those who still champion the cause of peace, and the Wandering Caravan, alongside you, will start the Golden Carnival, a show that might be able to stop the beginning of a new cycle of hatred.

After the conclusion of the Golden Ticket event, players can look forward to the fully 3D browser game SAGE: Starbased in the next release cycle.
