Get your calendars and notepads out, and get ready to mark down some dates and crucial information. In this article, we’ll walk you through when and how the airdrops and utility below will shake the entirety of the Star Atlas ecosystem! If you don’t know what Crew Packs are, you can learn everything you need to know in this article right [here](https://medium.com/star-atlas/a-new-release-on-the-horizon-star-atlas-crew-packs-coming-in-q2-2024-e2603415bc65).*

## A TL;DR for the Impatient Captains

In this article, we’ll establish a timeline of important dates related to the crew cards campaign, alongside other important details about how things will unravel. Nevertheless, if you are already familiar with Crew cards and are here just for the dates, your wait is over:

- **August 8 (3PM EST): Snapshot of ship owners**
- **August 9: Airdrop of crew packs and ship components to ship holders**
- **August 13: Crew Pack sales and opening experience releases**
- **August 20: Crew support added in SAGE Labs**

For everyone else, let’s explore each step in detail to ensure you have all the information you need to thrive and build the best fleet possible for your adventures in Galia Expanse!

## August 8th — Snapshot of Ship Owners

![](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/ba1f7e055df355654a302d1a85a4ccb8fa470ed8ed1fc10bc5f13993b70fcbbd.png)

A snapshot of an upcoming airdrop is coming for ship holders, and you’re not going to want to miss it! For those confused about what the snapshot is, we have you covered. The snapshot is like a photograph of your holdings on the blockchain. If you’ve purchased and hold Star Atlas ships, you’re entitled to an airdrop of Crew Packs and ship components under the correct conditions that we’ll list below.

To be eligible for the snapshot and subsequent airdrop, your ships must be in one of the following:

- A player wallet, either a cold or hot wallet, on the Solana Blockchain.
- Star Atlas Faction Fleet Program.
- Star Atlas SAGE Labs.
- Star Atlas Galactic Marketplace.

Players whose fleets are deployed in other programs at the time of the snapshot, such as**escrow services and third-party apps like marketplaces**,**WILL NOT BE ELIGIBLE.**

This snapshot will happen on**August 8th at approximately 3:00 PM EST**. More information on the logic of the airdrop below.

## August 9th — Airdrop of Crew Packs and Ship Components

![](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/ef879f79f67222be6b429fb2e0bc8893f88ca1ddc135ad34745369144db12a31.png)

There are two items we’ll be airdropping to ship owners’ [play.staratlas.com](http://play.staratlas.com) inventory. One is**Crew Packs**, and the other is**ship components**. Let’s tackle these one at a time.

## Crew Packs Airdrop

We’re airdropping approximately 2.5 million crew members to existing ship holders. Yeah, you heard that right, and there’s logic here that’s important to understand. Each ship currently comes with crew, which can be seen in the item details of any ship on the Galactic Marketplace. For each single crew member your ships come with, you’ll receive a single crew pack that contains one crew member.

Like full Crew Packs with 5 crew members, these single crew member Crew Packs can come with Silver, Gold or Platinum probabilities. The deciding factor for what type of Crew Pack(s) you get in the airdrop is the rarity of your ships.

- **Common and Uncommon ships** — Silver singular crew packs
- **Rare and Epic ships** — Gold singular crew packs
- **Legendary and Anomaly ships** — Platinum singular crew packs

## Ship Components Airdrop

Alongside the Crew Packs airdrop, we’re also airdropping ship components in the form of “Ship Parts Bundles”.

Like crew, you can find the components your ships come with by going to “item details” when clicking on your ships on the Galactic Marketplace. For these components, every ship is entitled to its own “Component Bundle”. For example, a Fimbul Airbike comes with 11 components, including a “Power Core” and a Tractor Beam. You’ll be receiving all of those components in a “Fimbul Airbike Component Bundle”. This logic applies to every ship.

All ships come with different “tiers” of components in the airdrop as well, to check what tiers your ship(s) will get, you can read [this article on ship components](https://medium.com/star-atlas/star-atlas-3rd-generation-ship-configuration-system-9c067d2e681).

## Other Very Important Airdrop-Related Notes

Now that you understand these airdrops, we have a couple of house-cleaning disclaimers and notices to give:

- After this airdrop, ships will NO LONGER come with crew and tiered components, they will have to be purchased separately. Ships acquired after the snapshot will require players to acquire crew members to be functional in-game and will possess tier 0 components by default.
- Ships sold in the Galactic Marketplace after the snapshot date will no longer be eligible for Crew Members or Component Bundle airdrops.

## August 13th — Crew Packs Launch

![](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/ef879f79f67222be6b429fb2e0bc8893f88ca1ddc135ad34745369144db12a31.png)

Finally, on the Tuesday following the airdrop, Crew Packs will launch! It’s finally time to get your Crew Packs and open them (Yes, this also includes the Crew Packs you were airdropped)! As a reminder, if you want more information on what Crew Packs are, what makes them so unique, and a lot more, please read [this article](https://medium.com/star-atlas/a-new-release-on-the-horizon-star-atlas-crew-packs-coming-in-q2-2024-e2603415bc65).

When opening packs, you can choose which faction you want your packs to hold. For example, if you’re Ustur and choose Ustur, you won’t receive ONI and MUD crew members in your packs. Make sure you choose carefully!

Once you open a Crew Pack, you can send your crew directly to SAGE Labs (more on that in the next section). If you don’t send them to SAGE Labs, you’ll be able to see all your Crew Cards in the “My Crew Cards” tab. In this tab, you’ll be able to read your crews’ aptitudes, personalities, and a lot more. Each crew card is a unique cNFT that exists within the Star Atlas universe!

Remember that your crew will also be tradable live on the same day! We have partnered with a strong third-party marketplace, which will allow you to seamlessly trade your crew members.

You will be able to sell or acquire them while filtering for the qualities, traits, and aptitudes you desire right after launch, so stay tuned as we save this last surprise for when we are closer to the release date.

## August 20th — Use Crew in SAGE Labs to Elevate Crafting Efforts

![](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/ea259fd3306755e865cd463dcb555eb8850cd49d312112d549f6e3ae83f8d874.png)

One of the first utilities we’ll be introducing to crew cards is their addition into SAGE Labs on August 20th! Now*,*If you play SAGE Labs**, please make sure you take note of the details below.**

## Crew Won’t be Tied to Ships Anymore

As we explained earlier, all crew members are now individual and unique cNFTs that exist within the Star Atlas Universe, meaning that they are autonomous units no longer tied to their ships. Because of this, we will be making significant updates to SAGE Labs regarding crew operations, which requires your action.

## Action Required: Disband Your Fleets

To enable crew in SAGE Labs and unlink them from ships, all fleets need to be disbanded. Before August 20th, you will need to bring your fleets to your faction’s Central Space Station and disband your fleets. If you fail to do this, we will forcibly disband fleets. This means that any cargo in your fleets at the time we force disband fleets will be lost. Don’t worry, there will be ample time to do this before crew cards utility goes live in SAGE Labs.

## Bring Crew into SAGE Labs Early When Opening Crew Packs

To make bringing crew into SAGE Labs easier, we’re allowing you to deposit crew in SAGE Labs when opening your packs! This is important because if you don’t do this, you’ll be required to deposit crew individually (transactions and fees galore!). Make sure to take advantage of this feature if you plan on bringing your crew into SAGE Labs!
