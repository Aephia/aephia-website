**Summary**

The Star Atlas Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) is gearing up for its next milestone: the election of the second Term of Council Members. This article dives into the significance of the Star Atlas DAO, the vital role of its Council, and the exciting updates to the election process introduced by PIP-10. We’ll walk you through the phases of the upcoming election, highlight key dates, and celebrate the community’s ongoing journey toward shaping the future of the Star Atlas metaverse. Power to the People — let’s explore what’s ahead!

**The Star Atlas DAO: Empowering a Decentralized Metaverse**

The Star Atlas DAO is the foundation of the Star Atlas vision for its cybernation. It is the heartbeat of a decentralized metaverse where players and community members hold the reins. By locking POLIS tokens in the POLIS Locker protocol, anyone can gain POLIS Voting Power (PVP) and participate in shaping the ecosystem — no minimum required. From funding community projects with the DAO’s multimillion-dollar treasury to influencing the design of Star Atlas experiences, the DAO embodies our motto: “Power to the People.” Whether you’re a seasoned player or a newcomer, your voice matters here.

**The Role of Council Members: Guardians of the DAO**

To streamline and organize the Star Atlas DAO we have the DAO Council. It consists of five elected community members who serve directly as administrators and stewards of the DAO’s governance process. Their responsibilities include fostering productive discussions on POLIS Improvement Proposals (PIPs), providing feedback to PIP authors, advancing viable proposals to the Star Atlas Foundation for voting, and proposing resolutions to enhance the DAO’s operations. Think of them as representatives safeguarding the community’s will — organizing proposals, moderating debates, and ensuring the DAO’s values shine through every decision.

**PIP-10: The Refined Election Process**

As the first council term is closing to its end, the DAO will begin preparations for its second election period. The upcoming election will be the first under the rules of PIP-10, a proposal crafted by the first-term Council to refine and future-proof the election process approved with overwhelming community support. The key changes include:

- **Extended Terms:** Council terms increase from 6 to 9 months, giving members more time to manage impactful governance initiatives.
- **Overlap Period (Starting Term 3):** From the third term onward, newly elected “Council Member-Elects” will observe the outgoing Council for one month, ensuring a smooth transition without disrupting ongoing work.
- **Simplified Voting:** A single ranked-choice (Single Transferable Vote) voting round replaces the multi-round system, streamlining elections regardless of candidate numbers.
- **Consistent Rules:** PIP-10 establishes predictable guidelines for all future elections unless amended by a new PIP.

These updates balance continuity with fresh perspectives, making the DAO stronger and more efficient.
