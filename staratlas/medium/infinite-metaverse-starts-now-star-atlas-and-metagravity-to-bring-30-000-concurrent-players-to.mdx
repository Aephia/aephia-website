*In a joint vision to truly revolutionize gaming, MetaGravity will enable Star Atlas to scale from 5,000 to beyond 30,000 simultaneous players in a single game environment, creating a true metaverse experience.*

Star Atlas and MetaGravity are making their partnership for revolutionizing the gaming industry’s standards known to the world. Equipped with groundbreaking MetaGravity technology, Star Atlas aims to debut the world’s first super-massive gaming size with a record number of concurrent players, AI non-player characters (NPCs) and interactive objects within a single shared persistent environment.

This pioneering functionality is set to become a permanent feature of the Star Atlas game in Unreal Engine 5 following a future game update on the Epic Game Store.

This is a first-of-a-kind partnership for the industry at large, with the collaboration between the teams of network engineers and Unreal developers already netting the first milestone, a successful 5,000-player stress test in a persistent, single non-instanced environment using advanced interactive bots, shown at the [Solana PlayGG](https://solana.com/events/playgg) Game Festival in San Diego.

For the past decade, the gaming development sector has grappled with the constraint of limited scale in game engine simulations, with traditional systems struggling to support more than a hundred current players. Despite many attempts by both tech giants and start-ups alike, this problem remained unsolved — until now.

The new technology brings a dramatic scaling up of the concurrent player ceiling within Star Atlas to beyond 30,000 co-players and beyond, more than was previously ever possible in a video game. The partnership is on track to achieve an unlimited total capacity of concurrent users, with the number being expected to grow together with player demand.

Michael Wagner, Co-founder of Star Atlas and CEO of ATMTA, said:

> *“Since inception, Star Atlas has had the objective to build the best next-gen player experience, setting a new bar for the gaming industry. With its top-tier galactic-scale game spearheading a multi-genre space saga, Star Atlas had to look beyond the currently available technologies and use ​​cutting-edge tech know-how to bring its vision of a persistent high-fidelity metaverse to life.”*

> *He continued: “In a vast, prosperous ecosystem that rivals a real-world economy, a single persistent reality for all players is the only acceptable option and our partnership with the MetaGravity team is essential in making this vision a reality. We are thrilled to be partnering with them to change the digital world for the better.”*

Leveraging MetaGravity’s advantages, the Star Atlas metaverse experience is geared to be free from limitations of scale, and it will enable a successful deployment of a massive public release.

Rashid Mansoor, Founder and CEO of MetaGravity, commented:

> *“At MetaGravity, we pride ourselves on our pragmatic approach to the challenges faced by the gaming industry. We are united with Star Atlas in the vision to create the next generation of standards that will level up gameplay and the experience of digital worlds for players.*

> *Our industry-beating cost-efficient infrastructure solution can support tens of thousands of players in a single simulation and integrates seamlessly with Unreal UE5, enabling Star Atlas game developers a robust, high-performance deployment onto our infrastructure effortlessly.”*

> *“As early pioneers of our next-generation infrastructure, Star Atlas receives dedicated support from our team of network engineers and Unreal developers throughout the initial integration phase,” he added.*

The MetaGravity platform is designed and built as an infinitely-scalable next-generation metaverse engine, which overcomes the limits of the current state-of-the-art spatial partitioning engines, including performance limitations, scale limitations and cost-prohibitiveness, helping Star Atlas raise the bar in game development.
