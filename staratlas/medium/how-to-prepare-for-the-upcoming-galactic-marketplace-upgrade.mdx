Get ready to unlist all NFT purchase/sell orders from the marketplace; plus, ATLAS/USDC pairing news.

![“No matter where you are in the cosmos, change is inevitable. Whether it’s positive or negative depends on your level of preparation.” — Pan.soul, Chief Operations and Logistics, ATMTA Inc.](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/da0ce6f9ee779a662572e1c950792b9282b53df6a5f94f18f307d3cf85d18a59.png)

The Star Atlas team will soon be conducting long-planned maintenance and upgrades to the Galactic Marketplace. Due to changes involving the site’s Serum-based infrastructure, current open orders to buy or sell ships or other NFT assets will no longer be visible in the marketplace after the upgrade.

**If you would like your current open orders to be visible after the upgrade, it is recommended that you unlist them from the current marketplace (following the steps below) by July 20 — and then relist them on the upgraded marketplace after July 21.**

Please note that the Serum DEX will still be working in the background. Your orders will still exist but they will not be visible on the Star Atlas Marketplace.

This maintenance will not impact existing ships or fleets, including any ships that are currently enlisted in Faction Fleet (SCORE). Only existing open orders on the current marketplace are impacted.

To delist/close open orders, do the following:

1. Go to [step.finance](https://www.step.finance/)
1. Click on “See Your Portfolio”
1. Connect your wallet
1. Wait for the DEX table to appear
1. Click “Cancel” or “Cancel All”
1. DEX view will refresh to show unsettled balances
1. Click “Settle All”
1. Your wallet will now show your assets as digital collectibles. You’re now ready to list your assets (once the marketplace upgrade is complete).

Would you like to see these steps in action? [Watch the ‘how to’ video](https://vimeo.com/728231228/d5263d31aa).

If you are looking to close orders in bulk, the easiest way is also through[ https://step.finance/](https://step.finance/).

**Repricing ATLAS market pairs**

With the deprecation of Serum for Marketplace orders due to the new Marketplace program, ATMTA is taking the opportunity to relist assets in the NFT/ATLAS pairs at USDC target market prices.

When ships and other assets are relisted on the new Marketplace, they will be updated to the current ATLAS/USDC exchange rate.

What does this mean when shopping? It implies that all ships during GAO Phase 2 will cost more in ATLAS to purchase than they do at present, a direct result of the USDC exchange rate of ATLAS going down persistently during this period.

For example, at the time of this writing, a new Opal Jetjet is priced at $300. Months ago, when one ATLAS was worth $.10, the price to buy a Jetjet was 3000 ATLAS.

In the new Marketplace, the Jetjet will sell for the current ATLAS/USDC exchange rate (roughly 1 ATLAS = .007) for a price of roughly 42,850 ATLAS (market prices may vary).

In other words, many of the implied discounts on the market today will be eliminated upon relisting in Marketplace 2.0. This process will return parity in pricing between both USDC and ATLAS market pairs.

The price in USDC for all new assets including ships will remain the same during this transition period.
