Unlocking the next part of the Star Atlas [Meta-Poster](https://play.staratlas.com/rebirth) sequence, the award-winning electronic music duo[ BASSJACKERS](https://twitter.com/Bassjackers?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) launched its first NFT into the metaverse on May 8th.

Fusing an intergalactic electro house soundscape with a stunning visual experience and immersive augmented reality, BASSJACKERS fans have been eager to get their hands on a slice of history before the one-time sale ends on May 15th.

Luckily for stellar sound-loving Star Atlas citizens, this week’s meta-poster won’t be the last time we hear fresh beats from BASSJACKERS. Future soundscapes in the Star Atlas meta-poster series, available on the[ Star Atlas](https://play.staratlas.com/rebirth) marketplace, will also feature the iconic electronic music duo.

The Dutch duo BASSJACKERS, comprising DJ Marlon Flohr and producer Ralph van Hilst, exploded onto the music scene in 2011 when their hit “Mush Mush” was picked up and released by Tiësto. The track quickly dominated the music festival scene and skyrocketed BASSJACKERS into the stratosphere of the music industry. Featured on collabs with the likes of Martin Garrix, Afrojack, and Snoop Dogg, BASSJACKERS is now at the top of their game. And what better way to celebrate these successes than to dive into the exciting and truly immersive world of NFTs and the metaverse?

> “*Collabs like these with Star Atlas open up a whole new dimension inside us. Or lets loose what was in there all along? It’s challenging trying to combine multiple purposes: setting a vibe to breathtaking art whilst also making sure it will go off live, bassjackers style.*” — Marlon Flohr

Star Atlas is certain the BASSJACKERS’ first NFT foray into the metaverse has accomplished those purposes and set a future standard for truly immersive and mood-altering audio-powered NFTs in the marketplace.

> *“BASSJACKERS* *has more than 3 million monthly listeners on Spotify with YouTube views reaching up to 120 million — this is an astronomical opportunity for Star Atlas to reach a new audience and truly act as a bridge between music fans and NFT enthusiasts*. *We couldn’t be more excited to continue our collaboration with BASSJACKERS* *and open up the underlying opportunities of the metaverse. Who knows what the future holds for visionaries truly making waves across a variety of industries and platforms?*” said Pablo Quiroga, Star Atlas co-founder and COO

Subject to cosmic laws of entropy, this week’s BASSJACKERS’ NFT is available to Atlassians for a quickly shortening duration. Make sure to purchase this week’s meta-poster by the 15th of May before it disappears from the Star Atlas marketplace forever.

While this isn’t the last chance to snag a BASSJACKERS NFT, jump into deep space now to grab a monumental meta-artwork before the window of opportunity closes for good.
