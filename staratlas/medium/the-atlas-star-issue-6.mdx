*A tale about building a new world…*

![The Showroom /// Triple-A Metaverse Work in Progress /// Immersive Unreal Engine 5 Experience](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/b601fb718ae2ffb5fdcef6b2ac509b26ea2d731275c4b48917eef45f67144475.png)

Attention, Deep Space Explorers!

We are back for another epic Atlas Star ✧, the official Star Atlas newsletter wherein you find all the crucial information you so anxiously seek about Star Atlas and related [project developments](https://www.notion.so/staratlas/72cb710bbd894cd8819bde948e42ac31?v=6146a2da2c0a45b58e0c4fb1c0a2d845)!

For this issue, we’ll focus on the economy of our expansive metaverse. We’ll take a deep space dive into the guidelines that our play-to-earn model works with, and especially, how players will integrate themselves into the elegant Star Atlas economic system.

Without further ado, let’s get started!

## The economy of careers in Star Atlas — a new model of generating value for a new age of gaming.

![Let’s get down to business /// Triple-A Metaverse Work in Progress /// Immersive Unreal Engine 5 Experience](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/4ef53613e13d7eaf15c30b78c7e693476f5659d014bc1865fd33713a616bdc7b.png)

We want to start by saying that Star Atlas is creating an entirely new economic system to accommodate its gaming and metaverse experience.

If you pay attention to our phrasing, you’ll learn something crucial for the Star Atlas Team: Our economy is not an end in and of itself. It’s a means to an end, or more accurately, to two different ends that are entwined in our project, the gaming experience and the metaverse experience.

We believe that any project that focuses on the formal structure of an economic model while losing sight of the product it should support is bound to fail. Here at Star Atlas, we are building to last a millennia beyond 2620.

With these considerations in mind, we built our [economic paper](https://staratlas.com/economics-paper.pdf), constantly refining it with the help of the many talented individuals that we’ve onboarded to our team.

Although we can’t disclose the results just yet, it’s time we start talking about the concepts and logic that we’re utilizing in our model.

Today we’re focusing on one pillar of that model: the careers that our community will pursue in their quest for fulfillment and fortune in our play-to-earn economic model.

## The two different careers logic in Star Atlas: ingame careers and metaverse careers

![Health insurance not included in monthly benefits /// Triple-A Metaverse Work in Progress /// Immersive Unreal Engine 5 Experience](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/3bd644f291811a6fb7db87c81a6de6e333255476e72d1918dc96a16e0bfe8e25.png)

Whenever we talk about economic activities in the metaverse or the natural world, we must speak first of value, also known as wealth.

In a free market environment like the one we strive to build in Star Atlas, every good and service has value. The determination of the value of each is linked to how the community of consumers perceives its utility, desirability, and scarcity.

This is the foundation of everything we’re building here in Star Atlas and is especially important for our conversation about ingame careers.

The logic behind the ingame careers is that we will onboard millions, if not billions, of players to this universe. Each of them will have different desires, needs, agendas, backgrounds, and ideas about what is entertaining, necessary, exciting, frivolous, right, wrong, etc.

To give such a wide range of players exciting gameplay opportunities to fit their unique hopes and desires, we’re developing two different macro career paths in our project.

The first are in-game careers, and the second, for the lack of a better name, are metaverse careers.

## The In-game Careers Logic: Skill Progression, Specialization, and Communitary gameplay

![This beauty is ready for deployment, call the pilots. /// Triple-A Metaverse Work in Progress /// Immersive Unreal Engine 5 Experience](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/cbd2d6f942679097868915557019704e15fe03ba460256276006fbc403090fa5.png)

In the last issue of Atlas Star, we spoke about the importance of communitary gameplay in Star Atlas.

As discussed, our game’s many different endgame objectives demand a level of coordination and range of skills from different players. That’s why it’s highly suggested that you find a dedicated group of friends — or even strangers — to form a DAC (guild) to help you face the many dangers of the galaxy.

But as we focused on the guilds and groups in the past edition, today we are discussing individuals and their lives in Star Atlas, starting by addressing how the ingame careers will work in Star Atlas.

We will tackle the main logic underlying the different ingame careers, each developed following these principles:

a) It must be a fulfilling game experience in itself

b) It enables the construction of a skill progression system

c) It must be integrated with the whole economy of Star Atlas and balanced

Let’s briefly discuss each of these points.

The first references the idea of careers in Star Atlas being enjoyable gaming experiences. As we did our research regarding careers in Star Atlas, we saw that most of the games in the industry didn’t focus on making playing different careers enjoyable.

We think this logic is bad for the game. If careers are not cool enough to play, people will take them on only for the financial rewards. While some people will think this is enough value, others won’t, and this may drive them to stay out of the economy of our game.

Although we can’t go into specifics right now, we’re looking forward to making playing each of our careers entertaining! All of them will have an underlying logic and mechanics that will resonate with different gameplay styles, from mining in deep space to racing leagues on low gravity moons. Hopefully, you will quickly find the one that best fits your taste.

The second principle emphasizes the idea of progression. We want you to get better and feel your character getting better while you devote yourself to your career in Star Atlas.

As you practice and work in your career, you will receive a range of perks that come from experience and hard work in any area of knowledge. For example, you will be more efficient, meaning that you’ll take less time to complete tasks, and you will receive increased yield for your efforts.

This dynamic, of course, changes from career to career, but we want our community to feel the effects of career progression in their gameplay as they rise through the ranks of mastery within their crafts.

Finally, every single career is made to be part of an economic loop or game activity with meaningful value for the whole Star Atlas game system. This means, just like in real life, no ingame career is an end in and of itself.

It serves a higher purpose on a political and economic level for Star Atlas, and each one of those careers is balanced in a way that is relevant to the game structure.

As you can see, we made “the box” of gameplay broad here, trying to fit many different playing styles. We will continue to develop these careers and their boxes in ways that refine them into more entertaining gameplay loops, and will probably expand careers and roles in the process

But, as we said, the box logic can only take Star Atlas so far, even if they are cool and big boxes. Now, we will start addressing our solution for the bigger picture, the idea that humanity is more complex than game structures can represent. Please follow us to the metaverse careers path.

## The Metaverse Careers Logic: Freedom, out of the box, and gamified metaverse experience gameplay

![The whole metaverse will be watching you, no pressure. /// Triple-A Metaverse Work in Progress /// Immersive Unreal Engine 5 Experience](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/d7fb340681ae84ae1988a25db3b0ef48afe24b0c9ab7c7e3f5912719d5602bd4.png)

The metaverse careers logic is significantly different from the one we used to develop the ingame careers program.

It actually begins with the notion that we are not the ones developing the metaverse careers in Star Atlas. Instead, this will be the work of community members finding ways to bring value to their fellow players through activities they find meaningful.

Here are some examples.

Imagine you and your guild friends are hanging out in one of the many Star Atlas bars after a life and death mission across the high-risk zone. You’ve seized awesome loot, escaped the pirates, and are now safe and sound back home.

Time to celebrate!

You place a brew delivery order for the team inside Star Atlas that will arrive at everyone’s Earth-based homes in 15 minutes, and then you ask the owner to get the music going. That’s when a real-life band starts playing and your crew gets to enjoy this live-action show together in one place as one team, no matter your location in the physical world.

As you can see, the act of ordering goods and services inside Star Atlas entails different metaverse careers actions. They add value to the community and will be rewarded in our ingame currency Atlas.

This is the first idea underlying the metaverse careers. They will organically appear from the new and exciting relationships that the metaverse and natural-life integration makes possible.

To help the growth of so many exciting possibilities related to metaverse careers, Star Atlas focuses on creating a variety of tools and mechanics that will enable the community to let their imaginations run wild.

From financial products, like insurance, to tourism in deep space, Star Atlas will focus on providing the infrastructure necessary to make this relationship possible between players and even third parties, whom we think will be very interested in providing different and exciting possibilities for our players.

The second characteristic of metaverse careers is that they are not bound to game mechanics like the progression in the skill tree system. You will be as good in Star Atlas as you are in the natural world. You can be an extraordinary lawyer, and you can also use your skills directly in SA.

This will enable even non-gamers to bring value to our economy while having fun with the actual game. Thus, this will make them gamers as well, right? Although we don’t know the answer to that, we know that this will enable anyone from any background to find a place in Star Atlas and build their path alongside our community in creating a new and exciting galaxy.

The third aspect of metaverse careers is that they are a great way of bringing a new influx of economic valueto Star Atlas, leveraging the game economy to new heights of sophistication.

At the beginning of this newsletter, we discussed how important the notion of value was to building an economy. Now imagine how much value this integration with the natural world could bring to Star Atlas?

Finally, the third aspect of the metaverse careers is that it works as a sandbox feature. Everyone, from players and third parties, can set aside the wars, politics, and significant concerns of the game and just have fun outside the core game loop.

This will bring a dimension of natural-life inside the metaverse life for our community. You will be able to experience lots of the different, cool stuff that you do in your free time in natural-life inside Star Atlas. This will enable a deeper connection with our world and stronger bonds between community fellows.

## “Power to the People” means an economy that balances individuality, freedom, entertainment, and tough choices.

![All right guys, fill this up with the ores! We are against the clock here! /// Triple-A Metaverse Work in Progress /// Immersive Unreal Engine 5 Experience](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/573a8d10bd29a7afe1b2f68f4e0442f86b8799b0fa2d401f030c282daca835a5.png)

We hope that the conceptual part of our careers design has you excited. We envision an enjoyable universe and fulfilling professions that allow every player to enrich our game in countless different ways. This certainly has our eyes shining.

We want to address one last note. Just as in the natural world, grinding your way through multiple careers is not synonymous with Star Atlas success.

You will need vision. Resources will be scarce in Star Atlas, and one of the rarest will be time. From the thousands of endeavors you can undertake, only a few will be compatible within your gaming hours.

That’s what makes the gameplay exciting, though. You will need people with different areas of expertise inside the game to achieve your grand objectives, adding a layer of coordination and trust to interactions between players.

These are all well-designed components that will make Star Atlas thrilling and challenging. We hope that, at the end of the day, after facing many exciting and demanding situations, you’ll feel you earned your rewards.

In the not-so-far-away future, we will start disclosing some of the micro-level career designs of our project. So please keep your eyes peeled for more about further developments.

## The Punaab Whisper — The Atlas Star Tabloid

Rumor has it that something is happening in ATMTA’s headquarters.

Astrobards and drunks from every corner of the galaxy have heard strange news. Finally, it seems that something is coming to light. Although the specifics are still unknown, and even its name remains a mystery to the public. A single piece of information seems to have been smuggled outside the Company — a report with a single-word title: *Thinoae*.

After being asked by reporters and stakeholders, the ustur CEO of ATMTA said the following:

“We neither confirm nor deny anything related to this piece of information that has been released to the public. However, ATMTA is collaborating with the Council of Peace investigation as it’s true that some smugglers have tried and failed to remove anything from our premises. We may or may not have the results in 4–6 weeks. That’s all for the moment.”

Although there is much uncertainty as to what is actually happening, our sources provided us a copy of the so-called tale, which, to this editor, sounds more like a fable. Still, here in our respectable journal, we do professional journalism. It’s up to our readers to take their own conclusions. Check the text below:

___________________________________________________________________

## Thionae

A report of the investigation regarding the legendary creature.

Thionae’s story is involved in many myths and theories across the various bounty hunting bars located on the outskirts of the faction’s borders.

After months of investigation, we learned that there are many different versions of the nature and characteristics of this supposed “anomaly level” being.

In some stories, Thionae is a sentient rock that looks just like a planet, laying dormant and waiting to gobble up fleets that dare land on its surface to extract rare ores and materials.

Other reports describe behavior in line with an animal floating across space and attacking those passing too close to its supposed colossal mouth.

Another version of the story is that it’s a God of the Tufa Scourge, plotting in silence the advance of its rocky children through the Universe.

We didn’t find enough credible sources to determine the existence of such a being. On the contrary, logic dictates that such a creature, should it exist, would be publicly known and scanned through the various expeditions to deep space.

Curiously enough, there seems to be a profound fear imbued in the heart of the populations living closest to the Tufa space. They kept repeating that wise space explorers always double-check their radars before landing on a seemingly undiscovered planet in outer space.

Nothing found so far, nothing else to report.

___________________________________________________________________

Should that be truth or myth, that’s up for you, dear readers. Perhaps something is actually going on inside ATMTA? Is this the start of a trend of mysterious reports about secrets and tales about our galaxy? Wenn are the 4–6 weeks ever coming?!

This, and much more, will be presented to you in the next **Punaab whisper!** Stay here with us as we fight for your right to reliable information! As always, thank you for your lovely support!

## Roadmap Reports

![(Ecos Titan ship — The Super Phoenix)](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/da735fac59cccfcddfae94a10edb34a11838600ed6c74e91381392e7d755fdf8.png)

These were also entertaining weeks in terms of lore in our weekly reports! We published the adventures of Lieutenant Wenn, Yago, and the two new characters, Alicia and Brikda, from across the Star Atlas Universe.

The first report was the [MUD Recollection of the Past: Star Atlas Roadmap Scan #03](https://medium.com/star-atlas/star-atlas-weekly-development-report-mud-recollection-of-the-past-a3eb0356023e) in which we found out about the mysterious shared past of Lieutenant Wenn and Agent M4.

Our protagonist also shared some of his views on galactic affairs and morality. Then, suddenly, both agents found themselves in a pinch, with the episode ending in a cliffhanger!

We also learned that the Artificial Intelligence of *Unity BTOL x4 *has a big and sassy mouth!

The following report, [ECOS Crafting the Future: Star Atlas Roadmap Scan #04](https://medium.com/star-atlas/ecos-crafting-the-future-star-atlas-roadmap-scan-04-bc50c3413db6), shifted gears to another corner of the galaxy where significant events occurred as a Titan Ship was being built in the shadows. As we learned more about ECOS, Alicia and Brikda played their way through the intriguing and dangerous game of factions. It seems that in some corners of the Star Atlas metaverse, any mistake could trigger a massive and bloody war.

## Events Updates

On the last Atlas Star we shared our ambitious plan to onboard 1 million players to the Star Atlas metaverse by the end of 2022.

Ambitious plans demand grand partnerships and lots of hard work, and now we can disclose some of our behind-the-scenes progress. It’s with a lot of pride that we announce the first two of a series of big events that we’ll be attending this year!
