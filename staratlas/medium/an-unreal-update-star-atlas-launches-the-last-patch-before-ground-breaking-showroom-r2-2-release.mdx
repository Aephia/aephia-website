The sound of drilling metal beams, mixed with the smell of high-octane fuel fills the air of the Volant Station as Star Atlas concludes the last patch(R2.1.9) before the release of version 2.2 of its showroom.

This massive iteration brings many new mechanics, assets, and overall updates to the beautiful Unreal Engine 5 world of Star Atlas and allows ATMTA, Inc., the lead developer of the Star Atlas ecosystem, to test and prepare for the upcoming major release known as Showroom R2.2 when Star Atlas UE 5 product will leave its closed pre-alpha stage and start an open alpha for the general public.

Patch 2.1.9 introduces **four categories of improvements** in the Unreal Engine 5 game. They are:

- **Volant Station Environment and Racing**
- **Ships and Character Configuration**
- **Bot Battle Arena Third-Person Shooter Experimental Mode**
- **Infrastructure**

Now, let us dive into each of them and get you up to speed with the various new gameplay loops and mechanics!

## A High-Speed Circuit — Volant Station is updated to accommodate the new combat racing game mode

![Don’t let them get you. Keep moving!](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/410d58e47f0406131baec5d8273cef332e9cbee413ad1ff58a90601b39384025.png)

In a collaborative effort that unites the diverse talents of engineers and artists across the Star Atlas metaverse, the Volant Station has undergone a remarkable transformation, setting the stage for the exhilarating high-speed combat racing mode.

This new addition stands as one of the most significant developments in the Star Atlas project, offering players an immersive experience in the various facets of racing career gameplay anticipated in the upcoming showroom R2.2 update.

The recent patch introduces one of the most substantial enhancements to the Showroom map’s level design, revealing the previously concealed depths of the Volant Station’s basement level. This expansion includes a broader racing track, seamlessly integrated with a pit stop area and innovative in-road elements, collectively elevating the intensity and thrill of in-game racing.

Significantly, the R2.1.9 patch has revolutionized the game mechanics, featuring a complete overhaul of the hovering mode utilized by Star Atlas ships in ground racing. This refinement aims to enrich the depth and immersion for racing enthusiasts, offering a more engaging and realistic experience. A prime example of this enhancement is the advanced secondary motion mechanic, which is now incorporated into most hover-capable ships and provides a more authentic feel during intricate turns and high-intensity maneuvers.

The crown jewel of this update is the introduction of the**Single-Player Combat Racing mode**. In this mode, players face off against AI in adrenaline-fueled matches, where strategic use of weapons, items, and customized builds will push their skills to the limit.

This mode not only allows players to compete on the Volant Station but also introduces them to a variety of experimental racing tracks that traverse diverse environments within the Star Atlas metaverse, offering a glimpse into the future rewards and progression systems set to debut in R2.2.

Players are encouraged to refine their skills and familiarize themselves with the nuanced ship controls, diverse weapons, and strategic component options. This knowledge is critical for those aspiring to ascend as the premier pilots of the Galia Expanse.

As you probably noticed, customization or the possibility of changing a ship’s components is one of the new additions to the latest patch and is highly important for your in-game performance.

Hence, Let us look deeper into what is coming on that front.

## Assets Customizations — Manifest Your Essence In Star Atlas Galaxy

The R2.1.9 update reveals Star Atlas’ commitment to providing a deeply personalized gaming experience, allowing players from across the galaxy to express their unique identities in every aspect of gameplay.

We celebrate this ethos by introducing the new**Hangar Module** in Volant Station.

This feature enables players to view and customize every ship available in Star Atlas, offering unprecedented personalization. Players can now experiment with various weapon types, diverse equipment groupings, and placeholder configurable items, tailoring their ships to match their unique gaming style and preferences.

This enhancement significantly enriches both racing and combat experiences within Star Atlas and sets the stage for even more advanced customization options in the upcoming R2.2 release.

The update also sees the launch of the new**Crewmember Studio**, a groundbreaking addition that allows players to explore millions of combinations in character creation. This includes a vast array of skins and, for the first time, the introduction of different species, highlighted by the early availability of the Mierese character. This level of customization ensures that players can craft characters that truly represent their essence, adding depth and personal connection to their journey through Galia.

Beyond character creation, these newly customized avatars are fully integrable into Star Atlas’s various gameplay modes.

The latest Star Atlas update is more than just an expansion of features; it invites players to delve deeper into the metaverse, crafting their unique path and story. With these new customization capabilities, the Star Atlas universe becomes an even more immersive and personal experience, paving the way for players to leave their mark in the vast expanse of Galia.

## A New Experimental Mode — Introducing the Shooter Arena: A Test of Skill and Strategy

In its latest release, Star Atlas expands beyond its renowned intergalactic ship battles by introducing a new experimental mode: the 3rd Person Shooter Arena. This exciting development marks a significant evolution in the Star Atlas gameplay experience, offering players an opportunity to engage in more personal, on-the-ground combat scenarios throughout the vast Galia Expanse.

The Shooter Arena represents the next phase in player training and skill development within the Star Atlas universe. In this mode, players will find themselves pitted against advanced AI bots, challenging them to utilize a broad array of weaponry, ranging from nimble pistols to powerful sniper rifles. Success in this arena requires mastery of fluid movement techniques, including jetpack dashing and**slide** mechanics, as well as strategic use of cover and camera angles. Players must also develop an acute awareness of shield dynamics to emerge victorious in these intense combat encounters.

This exciting game mode is not only an exercise in individual combat skills but also a preparatory step for the upcoming multiplayer challenges anticipated in the R2.2 update. Players are encouraged to familiarize themselves with the various mini-maps available, each representing different ecosystems within the Galia Expanse. This exploration will be crucial in honing navigational skills and strategic planning, essential for success in future multiplayer engagements.

The Unreal Engine client has also undergone comprehensive upgrades on the program front. Players will notice significant performance optimization, the integration of the latest Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) technology, and sweeping improvements in both visual effects (VFX) and sound effects (SFX). These advancements collectively contribute to a more immersive and visually stunning gaming environment.

On the architectural front, several noteworthy developments have been introduced:
