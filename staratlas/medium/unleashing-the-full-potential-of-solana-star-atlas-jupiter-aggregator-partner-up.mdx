Star Atlas, the blockchain gaming metaverse powered by Unreal Engine 5 and Solana, has announced a partnership with Jupiter Aggregator to deliver an improved and user-friendly web3 experience. The two partners have worked together to bring Star Atlas marketplace users the best deals anywhere, made possible by the leading swap and aggregator service on the Solana blockchain.

The Jupiter Aggregator service is accessible directly from the Star Atlas Galactic Marketplace through seamless integration, enabling users to quickly exchange almost any token in their wallet at optimal rates and get right back to playing Star Atlas.

With Jupiter’s swap aggregation, players will be able to access the best possible price routes and token selection across multiple liquidity sources, all directly from the Star Atlas web user interface.
