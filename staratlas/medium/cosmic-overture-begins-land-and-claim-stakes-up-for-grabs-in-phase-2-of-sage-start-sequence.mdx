Galactic Explorers and Adventurers!

The race for space in Star Atlas has begun, and the pieces are already in motion. The [release of Showroom R2](https://medium.com/star-atlas/lift-off-star-atlas-launches-pre-season-with-an-all-new-version-of-showroom-5d5c219d598c) and the [SAGE game manual](https://medium.com/star-atlas/star-atlas-golden-era-game-manual-vol-ii-the-game-structure-c931a2c933a0) are historic milestones, and another galaxy-shaking event is on the horizon.

The **launch of [SAGE Start Sequence Phase 2](https://downloads.ctfassets.net/2kg7h835bpe1/3a7FmK2npGimxRoYniJsk1/c03712386f2ce3bc8dac4a8759c3752b/Golden_Era_Start_Sequence_Phase_II.pdf) on December 20th at 12PM (EST)** bears the name Cosmic Overture and is critically important to your odds of future success in Star Atlas.

In the same way that individuals and guilds have bolstered their fleets in the past few weeks by purchasing ships at jaw-dropping discounts of up to 80%, another rare opportunity presents itself now.

## **Land plots**

This will mark the first time in its history that ATMTA, Inc., lead developer of Star Atlas, offers land gameplay structures on the [Marketplace](https://play.staratlas.com/market/). This will allow anyone to acquire their own residence in the prestigious residential areas in one of the three main factions’ (Ustur, MUD and ONI) Central Space Stations. Explorers will be able to purchase up to six different tiers of land plots from one of the three faction Central Space Stations (CSS) in the Star Atlas ecosystem.

Also available for the first time will be claim stakes, one of the key pieces of infrastructure required to colonize the galaxy in our SAGE game.

You can see the perks and utilities of every land on sale in the table below:

## **Claim Stakes**

Claim stakes, critical to any mining operation, are also being offered for the first time. You will be able to acquire five different tiers of claim stakes to enable the colonization and infrastructure construction on worlds in the Star Atlas medium-risk zone in SAGE.

The claim stakes are the foundation of planetary gameplay loops in Star Atlas, and different tiers of Claim Stakes will provide different levels of benefits, as disclosed in the tables below:

For all the assets accompanying the claim stakes and CSS land plots during this phase of the Start Sequence, they will be delivered to the original buyer’s wallet via an airdrop after the conclusion of the promotional period, on January 31st, 2023.

The scales of power are about to tip again, and the events of the next phase of the Start Sequence will influence the trajectory of the game itself. Acquire your plot of land and stock up on mining claim stakes, and get ready for the golden era of space exploration!
