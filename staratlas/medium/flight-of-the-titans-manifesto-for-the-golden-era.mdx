Narrentos, celebrated journalist and the pawn behind the widely read *Punaab Whisper*, listened to the announcement by the Secretary and could barely believe what his furry ears were hearing.

For the first time in a century, 3 Titan ships would be offered for sale on the open market. On the one hand, this was concerning, as their destructive power remained unmatched. But the young Punaab inside him had always wanted to stand next to a Titan and experience their epic size and magnificence firsthand. Now he could potentially get that chance.

He raced back to the meeting hall where is friends and relatives were gathered.

“Does anyone want to hear what the Secretary just announced?”

He looked around, expecting curious and excited looks. Instead, they looked glum, almost hopeless.

He asked his Ustur assistant, libra.iddt, what was wrong. She thought about it for a moment. “It’s been a hard time. Maybe it’s just the natural cycle of life. Dark times, with seemingly more dark times ahead. Perhaps even war.”

The Punaab started to interject, but then stopped himself. Instead, he turned and raced out of the room, across two levels of the space station, back to his office and began to write.

Minutes later, a document appeared on the screens of the people in the meeting hall, and across millions of others across the galaxy.

It read:

> **A MANIFESTO FOR THE GOLDEN ERA**

> *Beings of the Galaxy*,

> *I’m here to share with you an intergalactic truth that might not always be easy to see, but which is indisputable even by the forces governing the universe. It goes like this.*

> *Here and now, we stand on the doorstep of a Golden Era. Our bonds have already managed to create a civilization that transcends even our ancestors’ wildest dreams, who hoped to live among the stars they could only imagine visiting.*

> *1. We believe in the power of the imagination.*

> *2. Power comes from the people, and is exercised directly by the people. We have the most talented workers, devoting themselves to advancing this ethos every day. We all yearn to see each other enjoy our lives in the way we see fit, among an infinite number of fulfilling paths.*

> *3. We live in a complex system, growing day by day, economically sophisticated, enabling us to dream of a galaxy where the power comes not from the top or the bottom but from the decentralized voices at the very heart of our society.*

> *4. We embrace difference, and ensure that everyone is able to enjoy our galaxy in whatever ways they find fulfilling.*

> *5. We are builders. We are not here to create small or easy things. We are here to push forward, stretch farther, and reach higher than many think possible.*

> *6. We see beauty in art, technology, and simplicity. We use technology to create elegant, groundbreaking art.*

> *7. We are adventurers and explorers. We believe in the brightest of futures. We do not shy away from the unknown. We go there to know there.*

> *8. We are constantly improving. All these marvels were built by us and those before our own time. Let us not forget how far we have come so rapidly and how much still lies ahead.*

> *The COP just announced that three titan ships, the ultimate expression of our craftsmanship and cooperation, will take to the skies again after a hundred years. Although they are best known as the deadliest weapons in the galaxy, they are also a wandering home for thousands of people. They prove that we can accomplish anything when we work together, even conquering hostile environments, like the cold void of space.*

> *Take advantage of opportunities as they arise.*

> *Do not lose faith. Do not abandon hope. The noise, fear, and doubt will soon dissipate, washed away in the cosmic currents.*

> *Time passes, and Iris never stops moving. The sunny skies of the Golden Era await us tomorrow.*

> *Narrentos*
