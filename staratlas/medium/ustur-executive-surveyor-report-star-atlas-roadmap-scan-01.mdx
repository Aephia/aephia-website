*Star Atlas Block Entanglement No. ###OMITTED###: A transmission recovered from the Cosmic Hypergraph is chronicling the status of the development progress of Star Atlas and its various projects…*

![Decrypted Star Atlas Transmission /// Metaverse Substrate Work in Progress /// Immersive Blockchain-powered UE5 Experience](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/6028fca5b89c3f05e15c7a6bf3ebf1bfd1c8f89a7597f322c063a64609033aad.jpeg)

It was raining outside the Headquarters of ATMTA Industries, heavy drops of water colliding with the reinforced glass of the panoramic window of the last floor of the building, where a pleased-looking member of the Ustur faction was closing his computer log before calling the day.

As he was rising from his chair, a few quick knocks at the door announced a visitor, the fourth of the day, the ustur reckoned, but, in the same way he did for the three before him, he welcomed the visitor with a kind voice:

“Please, come in.”

A young human cadet, who couldn’t be more than 25 years old, visibly nervous, proclaimed:

“S-sir! The report sir! We just retrieved the last information from the various projects, Sir!

“Oh, Wonderful!” the CEO of ATMTA proclaimed. “Would you mind following me and reading the report out loud?” He grabbed his coat and suitcase, while heading for the door.

“Absolutely not Sir! huh.. where should I start…” murmured the cadet.

“Why don’t you start with the Showroom, Cadet…” the ustur asked with a side glance while they walked through a very clean hallway, decorated only with a few pieces of art.

“Wenn Sir, Cadet Wenn!” the human quickly replied.

“Cadet Wenn! Please proceed, young man, how are our efforts going on the **Showroom** front?”

The Cadet was so focused on his reading that he didn’t even notice that they were taking the stairs, automatically descending the steps one after another, following the ustur.

“Our**Alpha Version of the Showroom** is progressing really well Sir! As you know, our Goal in the showroom is to enable our players to view their High Fidelity NFT spaceships in a hangar in MUD territory simply by connecting their Solana Wallets!” The cadet stated, while also adding:

“**The concept art** and the**game design** are**complete**, we are currently**building** the**art and the user’s experience and interface** at the moment while prototyping the Blockchain technology. From our last report, we can pinpoint that we have basically moved all the**art** to the alpha phase; we have the**full wireframes completed**, pending**only on wallet integrations.** The**high-fidelity styling pass received the first full approval** as well, you can see a sample of the art in the monitor, Sir.

“Excellent, Wenn! Would you like to see the video the showroom team sent me while you elaborate on the planned next steps?” The Ustur asked the Cadet in a jovial manner as he proceeded to the nearest terminal. Wenn replied immediately:

“Absolutely! I mean, yes sir!” He then proceeded to declare: We will next proceed to**implement the alpha meshes together with the surfacing**, then we… Wow… I did see the clip but…Sir… this is simply…”

“Epic right? The Ustur proclaimed with a proud smile on his face.

For a few moments, the world around them disappeared. Both, ustur and human, mesmerized. The video that passed before their eyes was indeed beautiful, even if it didn’t even reflect the latest development stage of the project, it was actually awe-inducing, and no enthusiast of space vessels would remain unmoved by it, the feeling of watching the first days of a universe birth.

“At the end of the day, we are all simple beings, ustur, humans, onis… We see big beautiful ships, we are happy.” The ustur declared. — “So, tell me Wenn, how are the other projects?”

“Sir, We have other four projects that are of public knowledge at the moment, the**Marketplace, System polish**,**DAO**, and**SCREAM.”**

“The**Marketplace** is being updated based on our user’s feedback. We are laying the foundations that are necessary to prepare it for the game experience. In terms of overall development, we are**nearly finished building the Blockchain structure**, while**modeling the basic structures for the user experience, interface, and front end.”**

“This entails that, since the last report, we have**finished the marketplace program, the first version of the high-fidelity design*,* allowing us to**make progress** on the**ATLAS staking program** and the design of the**modeling for the core user flow**.”**

“That is good news, especially the**ATLAS staking**. From your report, I guess we will now turn into**implementing methods that allow our engineers and front end to communicate with Solana** and finish the**modeling for the core user flow right?** The CEO asked while resuming their walk into the next flight of stairs.”

“That’s correct Sir. Proceeding with our report, we have now the**system polish project*,* whose goal is to guarantee high standards of quality for our user’s experience across all of our content, and this time we managed to**fix small bugs**, like the**website scrolling glitch** and the**new wallet enlistment showing 404 error**, while also adding**new features**, such as**when the user claims atlas a spinner pops up**, **different button icons to change variant depending on device’s window**, **styled disclaimer for the wallet**, and some other additions to the DAO structure”.**

“That’s quite the list Cadet Wenn, would you like a sip of water before moving on?” Asked the boss as they reached the next floor, filled with people walking around on their own errands, even though it was already late at night.

“You know… hydration is paramount to your species, the ustur advised.” Moving immediately to a water filter that was fixed on the wall of the ample corridor.

From there, they could see through the glass the whole scenario of the grounds of the headquarters, a literal city born from iron, coffee, and dreams.

Wenn thought about murmuring some kind of excuse to keep talking, but the ustur face showed no sign of accepting a no for an answer, so he drank the water, taking a moment to watch the rain that stubbornly seemed to attack the walls of the building.

He realized that he liked this. The Headquarters, the smell of rain coming through the glass, the people who were hurrying to complete their tasks just like him… He knew that not a single one of those faces hurried to complete their tasks just for the sake of completing them, but for what that entails, with each task that every single one of them completed, they got closer to their shared dream.

He let that sink in for a few moments. The pause was actually good for him to gather his thoughts on how to proceed to the next two projects.

The CEO broke the silence after a few moments.

“So, I believe there is a reason why you saved the**DAO** and**SCREAM** for the end huh…” as they resumed their walk through the last flight of stairs.

“Sir… as you know, the**DAO** and**SCREAM** are two of the most desired features in our project. Our community dreams of those two modules and…”

The ustur face became totally blank, unreadable, as they walked through the last steps of the stair.

Wenn continued.

“Well, the current goal of the**POLIS DAO** is to enable the first version of its protocol, which will promote community visibility into and control over the DAO treasury as well as establishing staking/reward structure to incentivize community governance. We are nearly at the**halfway mark on the blockchain structure and the user experience and interface completions.** From the last report update, we have managed to**settle on Tribeca for the main framework of our project** and are**waiting for the auditing process.** Meanwhile, we managed to set the wireframe interactions going and the proxy program development is also going well.”

“For our next steps, we should be able to set the reward algorithms going, finish the high-fidelity design and work out through the legal and economic parameters of the DAO. It’s a good advance sir, but I wish we knew all the answers that we have acquired through this process beforehand…”

“What about**SCREAM** Cadet?” The ustur inquired in an emotionless voice.

**“SCREAM*,* is, without a shadow of a doubt, the most anticipated module of Star Atlas right now Sir.**

After several inputs from the community, as well as our business intelligence department together with the game design, we redefined**SCREAM’s** scope to be a standalone minigame, allowing for players to have meaningful progression with their ships and to**work together with their factions to achieve shared goals**.

“The broader scope comes with good news, we are building**SCREAM in 3D immersive graphics**, and we have modeled**quite a few game mechanics and loops**! From our last update, we managed to**refine the blockchain architecture based on gameplay, building testable programs.** We are also**refining user interaction flows based on the said gameplay structure,** and are**working on the models for the front-end 3D web engines while also modeling the economics of the gameplay loops.**

“Basically, we are setting our models to test, and I got to say, they are exciting Sir.” Said Wenn, even though his voice was somehow hindered.

The curious duo reached the doors of the company, just before the pouring rain, and the ustur spoke.

“Even though all that news reflects good progress, something seems to be disturbing you. Why don’t you say it out loud Cadet Wenn?”

“Sir…I-I don’t know, to be honest, it just feels as if we could have come up with those solutions that we have uncovered before…” Wenn uncomfortably answered.

“Oh, I see… tell me, Cadet, how long have you been working with us? The ustur asked, eyes gazing at the world outside.

“Three weeks sir.” he promptly answered.

“Very well, in those three weeks, did you, or any of your co-workers strayed away from your duties, Cadet? Did you perhaps stop fulfilling your obligations or completing the assignments that were given to you to the best of your abilities?” Said the ustur turning over to him.

“No Sir,” said the Cadet firmly.

“There is no such convenient way to create a new world, Cadet. Every single dead-end is a victory for this company because it eliminates a false road towards our dream.”

“There is no time to lose with self-pity, we have a most sacred mission on our hands, and we honor it by doing our very best, every single day, like the both of us here now, past 2 AM working on reports for the community.”

“Our fervor and passion will end up winning, Cadet. Every single one of the two hundred team members of this company is a hopeless dreamer that will be damned before failing into making this the ultimate gaming experience this universe has ever seen, isn’t that right, Cadet?”

“Absolutely, Sir,” said the cadet, unwavering.

“Go sleep Wenn, tomorrow there is more work to do.” The ustur turned back once more with a shadow of a smile on his face, and went into the rain.
