_Without further ado, let’s dive in!_

Star Atlas – Golden Carnival 2024 – Schedule

## Golden Carnival

[Week 2 of the Golden Carnival](https://staratlas.hedgehog.markets/star-atlas/9hwN22t9AduCS5LgH5bX6PwimBLkwkccWVUmBHyHTRoJ) is behind us, and participants collectively contributed rought \~2.9 million tickets to this one (1.1 million more than week 1). This week, the event started on time, and the [winners](https://staratlas.hedgehog.markets/star-atlas/9hwN22t9AduCS5LgH5bX6PwimBLkwkccWVUmBHyHTRoJ) were drawn smoothly one by one.

This second week’s official description read:

> With the excitement of the first week’s drawing still electrifying the galaxy, all eyes now turn to the luxurious and elusive ships of the ONI Consortium manufacturers. This week, two of the galaxy’s most revered sponsors—the innovative Punaabs of Ogrika Harbors and the resolute Sogmians of House Busan—join forces to bring another wave of excitement and fortune to the Golden Carnival. These ships, crafted by the ONI’s finest, represent the peak of opulence and stealth in the Galia Expanse. Those daring enough to cast their Golden Tickets into the festival arena and receive Iris’s blessing will be rewarded with a chance to command one of those unique ships. Join the celebration, submit your tickets, and let the cosmic currents shine in your favor!

Leading up to the drawing and after they concluded, the community team played some Marble games on Dominic’s (Community Manager) Twitch account, giving away Golden Tickets, Crew packs, and even various ships!

Gamified x Star Atlas

## Gamified Sponsorship

Star Atlas has partnered with the Gamified show, run by Sam Steffanina from the WolvesDAO. In effect, this means that ATMTA is sponsoring the [Gamified](https://twitter.com/gamifiedshow) show, which, according to Michael (CEO), includes real-world activations with WolvesDAO.

Sam is a legend, and Gamified is probably THE best high signal space out there. I’m stoked to be working with him and the show as we enter this new phase of the market, the next era of Star Atlas, and the new paradigm of web3 gaming! [https://t.co/LkeDqQrQVW](https://t.co/LkeDqQrQVW)

Francesca (Director of Marketing) had the following to say on the topic:

> We are excited about our partnership with Gamified and the WolvesDAO, being a great example of a longer creator partner and network collaboration. This means helping with content creation, show and event coverage (GDC, Gamescom, Impact etc) as well as campaign integration to drive relevancy and reach with their growing audience. Also want to explore running creator tournament collaborations (Surge).
> 
> Gamefied is a good example of how we want to leverage creators for the larger paid activations that other games do where you are creating the right fit and collaborating closely with them for activations via tournaments or content or coverage and more.
> 
> For me finding the right creator partnership is alignment on audience, content, and message (and Sam is an **awesome** guy to work with too). Then align it with a longterm sponsored collaboration while scheduling work sessions to run through custom activations and involving the community together. Not just paying an influencer to post an inauthentic, sponsored message. That way you are helping each other’s content and channel grow together, while being an effective means to gain new, highly engaged players that will stay for the long term: because it’s authentic, organic, and the most **efficient** way to get new folks (even if it takes some time).

## Michael Tours Asia

Michael (CEO) is currently touring through Asia to spread the word about Star Atlas. This past week, he attended [ETH Devcon](https://devcon.org/en/) in Bangkok, joining three different panels while there (Alice’s Arcade, Memecore, and Sand House).

His next stop is the Philippines, where he will attend the [YGG Play Summit](https://www.yggplay.gg/) in Manila later this week (19-23 November). Star Atlas has a booth sponsorship at the Summit, and they are organizing a one-hour Surge tournament on the 23rd in the _Playmatch Zone_ (2-3 p.m. Manila time). In addition, Michael will hop on a panel there this Friday, the 22nd, at 2:30 p.m. Manila time.

## News Bits

To wrap this newsletter up, here are two final news bits that may interest you:

* The team has rolled out a small fix to their POLIS Locker that allows multi-sig wallets to utilize it. This does not mean wallet extensions such as SquadsX can now connect, but if you are able to write custom transactions that you seek to approve through a multi-sig (e.g., Squads), then now you can!
* Tulle (former NeoSwap) has [launched THEO](https://twitter.com/tulle_ai/status/1857508797847159212), a chatbot that will [help you acquire](https://apps.tulle.ai/star-atlas) what you need to get started with Star Atlas!
