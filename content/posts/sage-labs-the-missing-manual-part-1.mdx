**Quick Notes**:

* When something does not seem to work as intended, try refreshing the page. No, it’s not optimal, but it should at least allow you to keep going.
* We are not using ATLAS Prime (more on that below) in the manual so that we can print the fee costs in SOL. As the ATLAS-SOL price fluctuates, it is not a handy way to convey the costs of certain actions using this service.

Star Atlas Golden Era (SAGE)

## Introduction

After almost two years, the team has finally delivered the first, playable browser game! It’s not yet the browser game we want, but it’s the one we get to play right now!

If you came here after having seen some wonderful 3D graphics, then there is a good chance you are interested in the [Unreal Engine 5 game](https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/star-atlas-bead34) the team is building. Or, perhaps you saw some shots from the next version of this browser game, SAGE Starbased, due in a few months.

That is not SAGE Labs, though. But to explain what SAGE Labs is all about, we have to begin with SAGE.

### SAGE

Star Atlas Golden Era, or SAGE, is to become a **fully** **on-chain**, **3D**, **real-time**, **grand-strategy** game revolving around conflict, but even more so around **crafting** and **engine-building**. That is not to say conflict won’t play a major role; it surely will! However, the goal here is not to simply defeat other players, conquer new territory, and call it a day. **The goal is economic growth**. Players participating in this competitive economic simulation seek to set themselves up for profit.

As is the case with these sorts of games (well, limited 2D equivalents), there are short-term strategies and long-term ones. The best players will develop both.

It will take a little time for the team to shape SAGE; there is a long list of features planned to be released over time. The very first iteration of the game is now live, dubbed SAGE LAbs. The reason for this name is that this game is really a heavily souped-up version of the rudimentary UI the team was using to test the on-chain programs.

The team is currently finalizing work on hooking their much more sophisticated 3D engine to the on-chain programs. This version is planned to be released around the end of the year, most likely somewhere in the first quarter. Before that, other features will roll out, which will improve various aspects of the gameplay in Labs as well.

### Labs

But, at this moment in time, we are playing SAGE Labs!

In Labs, there is no combat at all. This version focused on the core gameplay, which is the economic simulation. You will be able to move your ships around, mine resources (R9), find Survey Data Units (SDUs), craft other assets, and redeem materials for Star Atlas rewards.

More information on all that will come with Part 2 of this manual. For now, we will focus on getting started and getting around.

Labs come with a very data-driven, close-to-the-chain kind of user interface. In short, it does not look & feel like other modern games you may be used to. This also means that it likely won’t be for everyone. That is not a problem, as (again) the team is working on a much more polished, modern game interface in the background. However, it does mean that some people sadly won’t be able to participate in the early stages of this economy.

If you do want to give it a shot, then hopefully, this manual will help smoothen the rough edges. The goal is to bring you up to speed and set you up for future success.

![SAGE Labs Launcher 2](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/53c147643c75cbaea86f4fc577d3a5a6c915f32c940270ee5b4c2b3c9fac4342.png)

SAGE Labs – Welcome popup (before connecting)

## 1\. Onboarding

Welcome to **Star Atlas Golden Era: Labs**! 

Go to [https://labs.staratlas.com](https://labs.staratlas.com), launch the game, and connect your Solana wallet. Make sure to connect the wallet that contains your ships!

If you are connecting an account for the first time, you will run through an onboarding process. During this process, you will have to make certain choices, which you can read about below. But first, make sure you have your ships available for SAGE.

### Faction Fleet

If all of your ships are currently partaking in the _Faction Fleet_ (SCORE) initiative, then your first order of business is to get some (or all) out. Ships that are part of _Faction Fleet_ cannot be used in SAGE.

_Note that you will need Toolkits available to be able to repair your ships to 100%. You can not get ships out of Faction Fleet if there are not enough Toolkits available to fully repair them!_

![SAGE Labs ATLAS Prime](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/746ef14f20c7f15d50bff2afc652cec70df9386a5d34554f858933d2f733ab32.png)

SAGE Labs ATLAS Prime

### ATLAS Prime

If you have connected a new Solana account, then the first choice you’ll have to make is whether you want to use the ATLAS Fee Payer, or ATLAS Prime (AP) as it is officially called. Enabling AP will make sure that any and all transaction fees will be paid in ATLAS, instead of SOL. This means that you do not have to worry about the amount of SOL in your wallet anymore; the only thing that matters is that you have enough ATLAS.

Clearly, this is highly beneficial to new people coming into the ecosystem, who are not yet super savvy when it comes to the Solana blockchain. Unfortunately, SOL is still required outside of SAGE, but one step at a time, of course.

If you are comfortable with Solana and paying fees in SOL, this is likely your preferred option. The team is running a custom program to enable paying the fees in ATLAS, which effectively means they are paying the SOL in your stead. To make sure they are not losing money on this deal, there is a _small_ ATLAS surcharge (15%) being charged on every transaction. Though the surcharge is low, on top of the very low transaction costs of the Solana blockchain, it does mean that the transaction price is effectively a little higher when using ATLAS Prime.

SAGE Labs – Character Creation

### Character Creation

Next up, the second order of business is the creation of a new character for your account. This consists of two steps:

1. You have to select your faction
2. You have to select a username

#### 1) Faction Selection

If this is your first time, you will be asked to select the Faction you want to be a part of. Perhaps you already did this back in the day, but you now have the option to either confirm your choice or choose another faction that suits you better.

You can not change your faction afterward! Your choice here will override any choice you made previously when setting up your account on the Star Atlas website.

This faction choice is permanent and will forever mark the wallet/Solana account you are using as a member of that Faction.

#### 2) Username

Next up, you will have to choose a name to go by.

Unlike the Faction selection, this is an optional step. If you leave the input empty, you will simply be referenced by your Solana account.

You can choose any name you like; it does not have to be unique. What’s more, you will be able to change it whenever you feel like it, so if you don’t have one.

#### Fees

Creating your profile will cost you **0.00552176** SOL in fees to store everything on-chain.

### Welcome to SAGE Labs!

With your character created, you are ready to go! The entirety of the Galia Expanse lies at your feet!

Your screen is showing the Main Dashboard, which we cover in greater detail in the next section.

If all goes as planned, you should be greeted by a _Welcome_ popup, that lies on top of the Dashboard!

![SAGE Labs Intro Help](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/0c01cb376643dedce1ab7bc78e4ce469209b75a9f7680859ad01ee12eafa021c.png)

SAGE Labs – Intro Popup offering you a shortcut to your CSS

Before you can do anything, you will need to import your assets and form your first fleets.

If you have no ships available, it’s time to visit the market. For the purpose of this manual, however, we assume that you already own some ships.

So, click the “Go to my Starbase”-button to open a new view, which we (in this manual) refer to as a _**Star System Dashboard**_. It contains several very important tabs, and every time you such a Star System Dashboard, the first tab, _Starbase_, will be automatically opened.

Note that the Star System this view belongs to is the _home system of your faction_. And the Starbase is not just any Starbase; it is your faction’s Central Space Station.

![SAGE Labs Ustur CSS](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/91c7b3351c40df0ac747aceb98757200c4eaf7ed16529aff3066da06744c795b.png)

SAGE Labs – Ustur CSS

You just followed a shortcut that brought you straight to your faction’s home system. Ordinarily, however, you’ll have to navigate here yourself through the Main Dashboard. To keep this manually logically structured, we will explore that dashboard first.

_If you prefer to read about the Main Dashboard later, and instead continue with depositing your ships and R4, skip to the section after “The Dashboard”, which is called “**Your First Steps**“._

## 2\. The Dashboard

Let’s first take a closer look at the dashboard you are presented with in SAGE Labs and the Header bar at the top of the screen.

![SAGE Labs - Header](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/45edc25f7e906a2a5ba2a1cdb05dbc10b9df9cf21d2987d1fd2a1cc7e3dcb3cf.png)

SAGE Labs – Header

### The Header 

Technically not a part of the Dashboard, but as there is not much to share on it, we’ll include it here anyway.

At the top of the Screen is a header that will stay visible while you are in SAGE Labs. It has the following elements:

1. Logo and name – The logo is a link to the Dashboard, but you can always use the “Return to Dashboard” button that appears beneath it when you have navigated deeper into the many menus and screens.
2. Your name and wallet – These are not interactive
3. The Atlas Fee Payer (ATLAS Prime) – You can toggle it on or off by clicking on the cogwheel.
4. A Disconnect button – Disconnects your wallet and moves you back to the Labs opening screen

![SAGE Labs Dashboard 2](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/e65bc945837b53e55e9e2931bef8602cb51745a8098dda7f5c28ad7965dd76dc.png)

SAGE Labs – Main Dashboard

### The Map

The most eye-catching part is easily the big map of the Galia Expanse, which occupies most of your screen’s real estate. The map is **non-interactive** and shows the (for Escape Velocity veterans) familiar 101 x 101 gridded map of the Galia Expanse. In it, there are **51 Star Systems**, which each contain a **Starbase** for storage, crafting, and fleet management, in addition to an **Asteroid Belt** for mining.

The 51 Star systems are divided into 3 groups of 17 Star Systems each, which make up each of the 3 faction spheres of influence in Labs. Each such group can be subdivided into “Safe Zone” and “Medium Risk Zone” systems. Although the difference between these zones plays no role in Labs at this point in time, it influences the naming of the various systems. The names will be quite important in planning your strategy!

The Star Systems that lie in each faction’s Safe Zone are prefixed with “UST”, “ONI”, or “MUD”, dependent on the faction. The systems that are part of the Medium Risk Zone are all prefixed with “MRZ” instead.

There are three systems that stand out, and these are the “USTUR”, “MUD”, and “ONI” systems (note the lack of a number suffix). These are the locations of the Central Space Station (CSS) of each faction, which is where your adventure will begin. Take note of the location of your faction’s CSS and the systems around it.

### Player Details Overview

This block in the upper left displays some arbitrary stats of the map and game that can be safely ignored.

### Sector Selection

Directly beneath the Player Details Overview is where things become interesting. Here, you can select any Star system you want to zoom in on, which you can do by clicking the “Navigate to Sector”-button beneath the list. This will open a different view, the _Star System Dashboard_, for that specific sector.

Note that this list is scrollable, and will list your faction’s Safe Zone systems at the very top. Directly beneath that is a list of Medium Risk Zones that are under the control of your faction. You can scroll further down to see systems from other factions, but you can safely ignore those. You are not able to use your fleets over there. 

Note that _Ustur CSS_ is referred to as _USTUR_ on the Map. The same goes for _ONI CSS_ and _MUD CSS_; these link to the ONI and MUD systems on the map, respectively. These are the systems that contain the faction’s respective Central Space Station.

### Fleet & Crafting Overview

At the bottom of the Dashboard is your Fleet overview. Here, you can see the location and occupation of all fleets you have created. This is one of the most important displays in the game, as it gives you a birdseye view of all the activities you are engaged in.

Every fleet has a button at the far right, which you can click to go to the location of the Fleet immediately. If it is in a sector with a Star system, then it will open the _Star System Dashboard_ (see below). 

Using the tabs, you can switch to your Crafting overview, to keep tabs on potential crafting processes you have going on.

## 3\. Your First Steps

Before you can create your legacy in the Galia Expanse, you first need to get your assets into the game!

### Using your Assets

The first thing you will need to do is import your ships and some R4 (Fuel, Ammo, Food, and toolkits) to ensure you can use them in Labs. 

If you previously clicked on the _Go to Starbase_ button in the _Welcome_ popup, you are already looking at a list of actions to take at your faction’s Central Space Station.

If you are instead at the main dashboard, you now need to open the Star System Dashboard that contains the Central Space Station. Fortunately, this will always be the system at the top of the list beneath “Select a sector”.
When you navigate to the system by clicking the _Navigate to Sector_ button, you will be transported to the dashboard for that system.

We’ll explore the Star System Dashboard in more detail later on, but for now, there are two buttons that are important. These are:

* **Deposit or Withdraw Ships,** and
* **My Inventory**

The first is used to move your ships in and out of the game. The second is used to move resources between your wallet and Labs (and your docked fleets – more on that later).

_Not_e: Every System’s Dashboard shows the _Deposit_ _or Withdraw Ships_ button, even though you can only Deposit and Withdraw ships in the system with your CSS_._

### Importing Your Ships

Click the _Deposit or Withdraw Ships_ button will open the following dialogue:

![SAGE Labs Deposit Ships](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/001ca0f6819f8abff6d3c11f73c7ffd373e31d4bf3755b67fa90da201572f04f.png)

SAGE Labs – Deposit or Withdraw Ships to/from the game

Here, you see an overview of all ship models that are present in your wallet and (later on) at this particular Starbase. For each ship model you want to move into the game, simply click the checkbox that is in front of it. If you have multiple ships of this model, you can change the number on the right-hand side. Note that you can forgo clicking the checkbox and directly input the numbers you want into the input boxes as well.

Once you are happy with your selection, click the _Deposit to Starbase_ button at the bottom-right and sign the transaction.

#### Fees

Note that each ship type you import will come with a _one-time_ **0.00203928** SOL fee to create the required accounts (storage) on-chain. Ship-deposit actions will cost you an additional **0.00033408** SOL fee per ship-type, every time you do so.

#### Withdrawing Your Ships

Now that we are here, the same dialogue can also be used to withdraw your ships to your wallet. Simply select any of the ships present in the Starbase, alter the number to your liking, and press the “Withdraw from Starbase”-button instead.

_Note that you can only withdraw ships that are docked to your Central Space Station (the Starbase in this system)._

### Importing R4

Returning to the Star System Dashboard, click the _My Inventory_ button next. This will open up a different dialog:

![SAGE Labs My Inventory](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/1485456c3fdcafdd0968a21e129345df02005a39672e7dc54997daf43d88c596.png)

SAGE Labs – My Inventory

Here, you are able to move resources between your wallet and SAGE Labs in a similar fashion as you previously moved your ships. Simply click the resources you want to move and/or enter the amount in the inputs on the right-hand side. Then click the “Import from Wallet”-button and sign the transaction that pops up.

Depending on what you want to do in Labs, you will need different resources. We’ll dive deeper into this in separate sections on each topic below, but here is a short overview:

* Movement: Fuel
* Scanning: Toolkits
* Mining: Ammon (unless IMP ship), Food & Fuel (in order to leave the asteroid)
* Crafting: –

#### Fees

Similar to depositing ships, the first time you deposit a new resource to Labs, you will pay a _one-time_ **0.00203928** SOL fee. Fortunately, afterward, depositing itself costs hardly anything, coming in at **0.0000066** SOL per resource deposit.

## 4\. Fleets

In SAGE, you are not operating individual ships; instead, you are operating different fleets, each composed of one or several ships. For everything besides Crafting, you will need to have at least one fleet. If you successfully imported your ships, you can now create one.

### Shared Space

Ships inside of a fleet share everything they need to function, be it fuel, ammo, food or toolkits. As such, you can add up the capacity each ship offers for storing such items and regard these sums when preparing for your voyage.

The same goes for the total available cargo hold. The amount of resources you can mine depends on the sum of all cargo space on the individual ships that make up a fleet.

### Creating New Fleets

Open the Dashboard of the Star System that contains your ships. If you arrived here straight after going through the previous section, you are already there. But if not, your deposited ships are in the top system in the Sector Selector list on the main dashboard.

While in the Star System Dashboard, click the _Starbase Hangar_\-button, to load up the following dialog:

![SAGE Labs Create Fleet](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/322c655f9e0dc6b91cb11cb3ab4b42558cf1faf35e3351138098b8351f609b59.png)

SAGE Labs – An empty Starbase Hangar

This is where all your fleets will be displayed. Obviosuly, at this point, you have none. Let’s change that! Clicking the _Form a New Fleet_\-button will present you with the following screen:

![SAGE Labs Create Fleet 2 1](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/3729de58c01553c1cd50d8465be21a8a0025c1c4d7e6245ecae2da54c9dd5250.png)

SAGE Labs – Create a new Fleet

This view may look daunting, but most elements here are just to give information about the fleet you will be creating. These numbers may help you make strategic decisions about the fleet’s composition.

At the top left, you see an auto-generated name for your future fleet. If you click it, you are able to change it to a name of your own choosing.

In the bottom half, you see an overview of all the ships that are present at this Starbase, that are not currently part of a fleet. Here, you are able to select the type and amount of ships you want to include.

As you change the selection, notice how the numbers in the top half change. These show valuable metrics of your future fleet. Besides seeing the combined size of the ships’ dedicated Fuel and Ammo storage, you’re also provided with the fleet’s total Cargo space, and maximum warp distance (more on that in the Movement-section).

### Size Limitations

Perhaps most important here is the Fleet Size, however. **Fleets are capped at 145 capacity points**, meaning you no form fleet that exceeds that point value in ships. Every ship has been assigned a certain point value. Smaller ships represent a small amount of points, while bigger ships have bigger point values associated with them.

Below is an overview of the various ship size classes and the points a ship from that size will represent within a fleet:

| **Size Class #** | **Size Class Name** | **Points** |
| ---------------- | ------------------- | ---------- |
| 1                | XX-Small            | 1          |
| 2                | X-Small             | 4          |
| 3                | Small               | 9          |
| 4                | Medium              | 16         |
| 5                | Large               | 25         |
| 6                | Capital             | 36         |
| 7                | Commander           | 49         |
| 8                | —                   | 64         |
| 9                | Titan               | 81         |

Ship Class Fleet Points

Note that _Hangar Bays_, which are present on some of the bigger ships, do not provide any bonuses in SAGE Labs.

### Unlimited Fleets

Though the size of a single fleet can not exceed 145 points, you can create an unlimited number of fleets in this iteration of SAGE. This means that you can use all of your ships in SAGE! Note that in future iterations of SAGE you will have to earn that privilege!

### Wrapping Up

Once you are done selecting the ships you want to include in your new fleet, click the _Form New Fleet_\-button at the bottom right. You can, at any point, click the _Reset Configuration_\-button to start over from scratch.

Congratulations, you’ve successfully created your first fleet!

#### Fees

Creating a new fleet will cost you **0.01107996** SOL per fleet created. These fees are Solana costs that will go to create the various accounts required to manage your fleet on-chain.

It’s good to know, however, that you will get **0.0056** SOL back when you later disband the fleet again.

## 5\. Cargo

Almost everything you do in SAGE Labs requires you to move assets around in the Galia Expanse. To that end, let’s look at how you can transfer asets between your fleet’s cargo-hold and a Starbase.

### Transferring Cargo to a Fleet

You can only move cargo around when a fleet is docked at a Starbase. Open up the Star System Dashboard for the system, and on the _Starbase_ tab, click the _My Inventory_ button.

![SAGE Labs Load Cargo](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/3b2da3708faf0f6564cfcd749f25980e8280aca05d72ac530f14cba5fbcadfc8.png)

SAGE Labs Load Cargo

We’ve seen this before, when discussing depositing R4 from your wallet to the game (and vice-versa). When you have a docked fleet, you are also able to move assets between the Starbase and the fleet.

First, select the resources you want to transfer to the fleet as before. Note that these have to be available in the Starbase not in your wallet. You can set a custom amount using the input-boxes on the right hand side.

Now, if you were withdrawing, you would click the Export to Wallet button. But we’re not! So, instead click the dropdown menu that can be found beneath this button, in the bottom section of this dialog.

This dropdown lists all of your docked fleets. Select the one you want to transfer items to and click the _Transfer to Fleet_ button at the bottom. Sign the transaction, and you will notice that your fleet’s cargo hold now contains something.

### Unloading Cargo from your Fleet

If you want to unload cargo from your fleet to a Starbase (or just see what cargo it has), you will need to follow a different route. Go instead to the _Starbase Hangar_ in the Starbase tab of the Star System Dashboard. Here, you will see an overview of your docked fleets. Click the fleet you want to unload and you are presented with the following screen:

![SAGE Labs Unload Cargo 1](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/2090bcc6952509f7ca405630ade5f3929b8003924ee439be76d9278beaaeb30f.png)

SAGE Labs – Starbase Hangar – Unload Cargo (red accents by us)

_**Note:** When you only have one fleet, you may end up in the above screen right away_

There is a lot to see here, but we’ll cover that in the Movement section below. For now we are only interested in the bottom part, the _Fleet Cargo Hold_. Here you see a list of all the assets the fleet has stored in its cargo hold. Simply select the asset you want to transfer to your Starbase, and optionally provide a specific amount in the input box on the far right.

Click the _Transfer Cargo to Starbase_ button to effectuate this change!

#### Disbanding

When you disband a fleet, all of its cargo will be moved to the Starbase. This also includes its Fuel and Ammo, which are stored separately. If you are planning on disbanding anyway, this may save you some time.

## 6\. Movement

You have a fleet, and now it needs to go and make you money (or other on-chain assets)! In this section, we go over the following:

* How to prep for your voyage
* Movement modes available

### Preparing your Fleet

Before you can move a fleet, you need to make sure it is fueled and undocked from the Starbase. To accomplish these tasks, open the Star System Dashboard of the system that contains your fleet. Click the _Starbase Hanger_ button to see an overview of the fleets that are docked to your system.

If you arrived here directly after the Fleet section, you are already on the right screen.

_Note:_ This interface also allows you to create new fleets, if you did not do so yet. See the Fleet-section above for more infotmation.

In this interface, you see a number of interesting details. However, for movement, only the _refuel_ and _undock_ options are relevant. If you deposited enough Fuel into the Starbase, you are now able to refuel your fleet using the Refuel 100%-button. It does exactly what you expect: it fills up the fuel tanks of the ships in your fleet to the max, at least, if there is enough fuel present to do so.

After having approved the transaction, you will need to undock from the Starbase, in order to leave its confines and go on your merry way. Click the _Undock_ button, approve the transaction, and off you go!

#### But there is more here…

Clearly, this interface offers a lot more than just these two buttons. Let’s go over a few more elements that may be relevant to you at this point.

What is relevant depends entirely on what you want to do, after you’re done moving. Do you want to Scan for Survey Data Units (SDUs)? Do you want to Mine an asteroid? Or do you want to transport goods to another Starbase? 

Let’s briefly explore these options:

#### Mining

If you want to mine, you’ll need to bring Food and Ammo as well. Food is done through cargo, which we’ll we’ve covered in the previous section. Ammo, however, is managed through this interface. Below the _Fleet Fuel Tank_ is the _Fleet Ammo Bank_. Here, you can add Ammo to your fleet in the exact same way as you added Fuel before. Click the “Restock 100%”-button to fill your Ammo bank to the brim!

#### Scanning / Transport / Mining

Scanning will cost you Toolkits. Mining will cost you Food. And if you want to transport something, well, you need to make sure you bring the items with you. All of these items go into your cargo hold. This means that you will need to add these items to your Cargo space. See the previous section for more information.

#### Crafting

If you want to craft something at a different Starbase, there is no need to bring anything but your fleet and its crew. You are all set! That is.. unless you also need to transport some ingredients, then the above applies to you as well.

### Move your Fleet

Now that your fleet is undocked and fueled up, let’s get moving!

So far, you spent a good deal of time in the _Starbase_\-tab. But now that your fleet has undocked, it can no longer be found there. In the Star System Dashboard, click the _Undocked Fleets_ tab at the top to see your fleet again.

SAGE Labs – Undocked Fleets

In this overview, you will see all fleets that are currently in this Star System, but not docked to its Starbase. There are two options per fleet:

* Dock (to the Starbase)
* Manage Fleet

Use _Dock_ when you arrive at a Starbase after movement, to dock to that sector’s Starbase. You will also do this after having _mined_ or _scanned_ the sector without having moved. For our purpose of moving into the Galia Expanse, we’ll go with the second option, _Manage Fleet_.

![SAGE Labs Manage Fleet](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/31a2d0a3a5d4aa38b35729db2834ca876f93708c1b4c9d7e61fd5f338ad2270a.png)

SAGE Labs – Fleet Management

Once you click Manage Fleet, a new dialogue opens. This dialog has several interesting tabs, but the one selected, _Movement_, is exactly right for our purpose now.

Contrary to the big map on the dashboard, the minimap depicted here is interactive. You can:

* left-click: select the destination sector
* right-click: move the map
* mouse wheel: zoom in & out

The gray square with a triangular spaceship is your fleet’s current position. Star systems are shown as orange circles, representing Starbases.

Let’s briefly go over the movement modes available to you.

### Movement Modes

There are two modes of travel in SAGE Labs: _Warp_ and _Subwarp_. These function radically differently, and both come with their own pros and cons. One universal constant: Warp is quicker, but it also comes with increased Fuel costs.

### 1) Subwarp

Subwarping moves the fleet to the destination you select, one sector at a time. Every sector you move through will cost you some Fuel. You will be able to select any sector on the map and get a Fuel and Time projection. Make sure to bring enough Fuel for the return trip as well, though!

After you have initiated a Subwarp, you will see the Undocked Fleet section again, with a remaining travel-time countdown.

![SAGE Labs Warp](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/d44ea6316961cd98aed8891138471b33dc7e63839bcce8b7e215f29ea32e5f53.png)

SAGE Labs – A fleet is on the move!

If you click on _Manage Fleet_, you will now see a similar countdown in the _Movement_ tab and a Stop Subwarp button.

The _Stop Subwarp_ button will trigger a transaction through which you can force the fleet to end its movement. Note that this is meant to be an emergency measure; you should always strive to subwarp your fleet to its intended destination. Using this button to stop subwarping will cost you the amount of fuel required to move one sector.

If you remain in the Undocked Fleets tab of your Star System, you will notice the fleet will disappear shortly. This does not mean the fleet has arrived; instead, it simply means it has left the Sector where it started its journey.

The only way to track it now is by going to the Main Dashboard’s _Fleet Overview_ at the bottom.

#### Subwarp Speed

The speed at which your fleet subwarps will be equal to the subwarp speed of the slowest ship in your fleet. This may be important to take into account during the creation of your fleet.

You can use this handy [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/d/1cfzW3uiqkbnfJexBysh0MAzZYRhiRwQg8WlsFWfuKgs/htmlview#gid=205337066) for an overview of all ship stats, including the subwarp speed for every ship that exists. Of course, you can also find this information in-game, just not in grouped together like here

### 2) Warp

The alternative to subwarp is Warp. It is much faster than subwarp, but also more costly. Furthermore, the distance you can warp is not limited just by the fuel you have. Each ship has a maximum warp distance, which means that you may have to warp multiple times to reach your destination.

Though warp is very fast, it comes with a cooldown. After every warp, your fleet will have to wait a bit before it can perform its next warp. Your cooldown will start directly after the fleet arrives, before you exit Warp (see more below).

#### Warp Speed

Contrary to subwarp, the warp speed of your fleet is equal to the warp speed of the fastest ship in your fleet. The idea here is that this ship creates a bubble that encapsulates the other ships in its vicinity.

The max warp distance is also equal to the max warp distance

You can use this handy [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/d/1cfzW3uiqkbnfJexBysh0MAzZYRhiRwQg8WlsFWfuKgs/htmlview#gid=205337066) for an overview of all ship stats, including the warp speed for every ship that exists. Of course, you can also find this information in-game, just not in grouped together like here.

### Exiting the Movement State

Regardless of whether you warped or subwarped to your destination, you will have to trigger an _Exit (Sub)Warp_ transaction before you can provide new instructions to your fleet.

### Running out of Fuel

If you run out of fuel, you better be in a Star system already. If you are, dock your fleet right away and:

* Transfer Fuel you stored at the Starbase to your Fuel Tank
* Transfer excess Fuel from your cargo to your Fuel Tank (via the Starbase’s storage)
* Get another fleet to transport Fuel to the Starbase so you can transfer that to your fleet.

### Respawning

If you run completely out of fuel, you have no other option in Labs but to respawn your fleet, losing all items in your cargo hold. These items will not spawn on the position you occupied on the map, but will be burned instead (this will change with future iterations of SAGE). 

To respawn, you will need to self-destruct. You can do so by clicking the big red _Self Destruct_ button in the _Manage Fleet_ dialog.

![SAGE Labs Self Destruct](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/37f55be55574e33a2680d02e3d46f108ea73e271e46202790b6d741c95b72434.png)

SAGE Labs – Self Destruct (this fleet does not need that, fortunately!)

Respawning a fleet is a very costly affair! No matter the type or size of your fleet, you will have to pay a flat 150 ATLAS fee. In the future, this fee will likely be dynamic and based on the actual fleet’s composition, to account for increased towing costs in such cases. For Labs, every fleet will be charged the same flat fee. Any fees paid this way will be sent to the Star Atlas DAO’s treasury.

Respawning will always return your ship to your faction’s CSS.

## You’ve reached the end of Part 1!

Go forth and have fun in SAGE Labs!
