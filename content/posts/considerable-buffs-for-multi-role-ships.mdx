With the emergence of the Pearce C9 (classified as a fighter ship), initial comparisons were made with the only other capital class ship in the marketplace, the Calico Guardian classified as a multi-role ship). And at first glance, the C9 seems to pack a lot of advantages: bigger, more weapons, more crewmembers, more Capital modules – at almost the same price.

Danny Floyd, CTO of Star Atlas, commented on the Guardian’s advantages: “Multi-role will be a **considerable buff** but exactly what that means is still under construction and will be balanced throughout late-stage testing.”
