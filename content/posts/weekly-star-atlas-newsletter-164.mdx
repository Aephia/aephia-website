Last week brought a mix of updates from the team. While some of the planned SAGE changes were rolled out—albeit later than expected—others remain in the pipeline. Meanwhile, the Golden Carnival saw its third Mega Week, with a record-breaking number of tickets submitted! Additionally, the community team opened up the (in)famous Foundation Room channel on Discord for public viewing and officially closed the Never Alone campaign.

_Let’s dive right in!_

Star Atlas – Golden Carnival 2024 – Schedule

## Golden Carnival

The [third mega week](https://staratlas.hedgehog.markets/star-atlas/FTZ3aDRP4qrPMZkeUtBLhRaYCz7ERGRcBA3GoDYXjgML) is behind us, and roughly $400k in assets (VWAP value) found a new home! Almost 6.7 million tickets were submitted this week, with 4.2 million coming in on Friday.

Solana congestion did, unfortunately, affect the creation of tickets, which pushed up the price of a single ticket to around 8 ATLAS on Friday. This may have encouraged many who were holding them to sell. The current circulating supply is at its lowest since the start of the Golden Carnival late last year.

Meanwhile, [week 13](https://staratlas.hedgehog.markets/star-atlas/2tzJoxfhHzFi2qYuKGmssBVsgRPZnEQZtjQYJ68ts5Mv) has started, which means the last 4-week cycle has begun. This is the last time this Carnival season that you can participate in the Pearce & Calico week! You can submit your tickets until Friday, 5 minutes before the drawing starts (18:00 UTC).

## SAGE Changes

There was some confusion in the team last week, which led to the planned changes rolling out a day late, at around 0:00 UTC on Friday. 

Due to the confusion, the team decided to put some FIC #1 buy orders back up in the old locations as well.

Not all the planned changes went live, however. Though the second FIC is now live for all factions, the SDU install timer change did not roll out. The team reported some last-minute issues they ran into as the reason for this.

The change is expected to go live next week.

### The new Faction Infrastructure Contracts

The new FIC recipes are:

* [ONI Contract – Vaor’s Order](https://play.staratlas.com/market/oiC26XFt8HR1xzw3Y6WJ9wMTdtY1g9k1mthMqwRAn1X/)
* [MUD Contract – Gotti’s Favor](https://play.staratlas.com/market/mic2AcEbMAjxoYGWaobvTMKzzNraSRVFaDaKEM2YrTD/?symbol=ATLAS)
* [Ustur Contract – Opos’ Request](https://play.staratlas.com/market/uiC2QNxpUxu1VqFefrbN6eDucaW2g9YnB4EZosMQeec/?symbol=ATLAS)

The ingredients are the same as for the previous FIC recipes, except that the amount of SDUs needed has been reduced to 5, and the 234 _Frameworks_ have been replaced with 94 _Crystal Lattices_.

At the locations where they can be redeemed, they can be sold for 2.2 ATLAS each.

## Foundation Room Changes

The Community Team made some changes to the Foundation Room setup this past week. The old channel was archived (though it’s still available to those who had access), and a new channel was created. This new channel has the same permissions for posting messages but a much-expanded set for viewing the channel’s content. The team clearly seeks to combat the information asymmetry by making the Foundation Room channel viewable by everyone. The Foundation Room _Chat_, a channel originally created to discuss the contents shared in the Foundation Room, will retain the old permissions, meaning it will only be readable and writable by those who have access to writing in the Foundation Room as well.

## Never Alone – Wrapping Up

This past Wednesday, the team removed all open quests from their Zealy Mission 3 board. With that, participants can no longer earn points.

Next up, the community team will:

* airdrop Mission 3 memories to all eligible wallets
* open up trading of all memories (for all three missions) on the Galactic Marketplace
* \[A little later\] add metacrafting recipes to SAGE Labs so that you can redeem your memories for rewards.

Note that redemption recipes will be added for all three Mission rewards, as well as the End-of-campaign rewards (previously: End of Year).

## News Bits

To wrap things up, here are a few more interesting things that happened this past week!

### 2025 Roadmap

During the [Atlas Brew](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isfYelfewkQ) the Community team shared some additional details of what to expect from the C4 release coming later this year.

* Claim stakes will come with some form of Planetary maintenance, and you will be able to add defenses
* The introduction of the Council rank progression system will control:  
  * Amount/type of buildings one can construct in claim stakes and habs
  * How far to go with the ship configuration system
* You will be able to design crafting habs in different ways so as to tweak the parameters of crafting output

Additionally, big improvements are coming to the ATLAS Locker in 2025\. Based on the tier reached, you will be able to pick the benefits that make the most sense to you. For example, you will be able to choose rewards that are more related to your playing style, which could be focused on the DAO, SAGE, or the Market.

### Lore Keepers

This past Thursday was the first time this year, but also the first time in months, that José (chief Noot) hosted another [Lore Keepers episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQDLntOO1uI)!

If you are interested in the lore behind Star Atlas, then do give the [recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQDLntOO1uI) a listen!

_You’ve reached the end of this week’s issue! See you next week!_
