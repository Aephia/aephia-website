Another relatively quiet week went by in the Star Atlasverse. For those not having won something cool during the Golden Ticket raffle, the new Navigating Star Atlas episode was most likely the highlight of the past week. Besides that, we’ve got some news on CORE, GAM3 awards, the special Rayfam special sale, and more!

Let’s dive in!

Navigating Star Atlas #2 – An Ustur jetpacking in the Third-Person Shooter (TPS)-mode \[Work in Progress\]

## Navigating Star Atlas

Last week, the team published their [second episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88IEZVf7WOE) of the new show hosted by Community Manager, Dominic, dubbed _Navigating Star Atlas_.

This time, Dom sat down with Character Art Director, Hanno. During the show, Hanno shows off impressive skin customization options for the upcoming crew characters. A noteworthy surprise reveal is no doubt the footage showing off a _more corpulent_ Ustur model in-game (see the image above)!

This episode, like the [previous one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHmp7HNk6gM) where Danny (CPO) was interviewed, is definitely worth a watch!

## Golden Ticket Raffle

Week 4 of the weekly Golden Ticket raffles is behind us, and you can now enter your tickets for the [upcoming raffle for week 5](https://hedgehog.markets/star-atlas/E1V4g4VMujQorwmeNGH29dDBUtfKni7CSQj99weVk7CL).

The prize pool for week 4 was bumped to 175k in VWAP value, but for Week 5 (and subsequent raffles), the size is back to $150k in VWAP value instead. This coming week is, besides the very first raffle, the only other time where you have a chance at winning a Fimbul tankship (VWAP 100k). It’s also the raffle with the most prizes, bar week 1\. A total of 146 prizes (mostly XXS ships) can be won this Friday!

The official announcement reads:

> The legendary ship manufacturer of Free Harbors, Fimbul, sponsors the fifth drawing. With deep ties to the history of the medium zone populations, this company presented us with over one hundred and forty ships to be drawn in our weekly event, including yet another Tankship! The fans of this daring company are more than welcome to try their odds with this exciting new drawing.

If you want to participate in the drawing, make sure to get your tickets in by this Friday, 20:15 UTC.

Aephia Data Runners – Golden Tickets: Circulating Supply

Looking at the [circulating supply of Golden Tickets](https://flipsidecrypto.xyz/Aephia/star-atlas-gameplay-analytics-star-atlas---gameplay-analytics-xGXyHF), we see that there is roughly a 500k floor on these. For every ticket that was crafted during the past two weeks, a little over 1 ticket was submitted to a raffle. 

In short, there are plenty of tickets out there in the wild, waiting to be added to a raffle. Note that the team has no plans to assign any utility to these tickets after the 8 weeks of raffles have ended! So be sure to use them beforehand in a raffle of your choosing.

Star Atlas CORE – Issue 10 – Alternative “Power of the Elders” Limited Edition cover

## CORE – Issue 10

When CORE issue #10 hit the Galactic Marketplace last week, the team communicated that the Magic Eden cover would arrive one week later. In our [previous issue](https://aephia.com/star-atlas/weekly-star-atlas-newsletter-106/), we expressed surprise, as originally, the team conveyed the message that Magic Eden would stop the sales of new CORE issues after issue #9.

What, in fact, happened is that Magic Eden is not selling CORE issue #10\. Instead, the [alternative cover is being sold](https://play.staratlas.com/market/C1oACSR5G8WWrDCTPeezj6GAcC2huXg4e3uDpqXAs16/) on the Galactic Marketplace. It is likely that the same process will be followed with the last two issues for Act 2\. In short, it looks like the original statement was correct, and the “Magic Eden” cover is now named the “Alternative” cover instead. This one, in fact, has a more specific name: the _Power of the Elders_ cover.

At the time of publication of this newsletter, you have 9 more days to acquire the Alternative cover, and 3 more days to get your hands on the original one. Both can be found on the [Galactic Marketplace](https://play.staratlas.com/market/?category=story&itemClass=graphic-novel)!

Opal Rayfam – Internal modelling \[WIP\]

## Opal Rayfam Sale

The special Rayfam sale is coming to a close! If you wish to acquire a [Rayfam](https://play.staratlas.com/market/RaYfM1RLfxQJWF8RZravTshKj1aHaWBNXF94VWToY9n/) from the team directly and receive a free Ogrika Niruch, then you only have a few hours left after the publication of this issue.

It’s more likely the deadline will already be in the past by the time you read this, in which case it is good to know that the Rayfam will stay available for sale from the team. However, the Ogrika Niruch promotion is over. Note that secondary sales won’t be possible still, until December 16th.

If you acquired the small Data runner before the special sale ended, you will receive your Ogrika Niruch tomorrow! Note that the team is unlikely to airdrop them directly to your wallet. Like previously, we expect the team to add a claim to your [inventory](https://play.staratlas.com/inventory/), which you can click to receive the ship(s).

## Sneak Peeks

Last week, it was Vertpaint’s turn to spill the beans, with them publishing a variety of screenshots dubbed [MUD Repair Tier 0](https://vertpaint.artstation.com/projects/XgWklD?album_id=3931464). It shows a MUD crew member, presumably being a part of the repair crew (during races?).
