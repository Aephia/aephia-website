## Official News

Star Atlas just released [Roadmap Scan #9](https://medium.com/star-atlas/scenes-from-a-galaxy-in-movement-star-atlas-roadmap-scan-09-24995975940c), where the lore piece is bringing us closer to the upcoming COPA event. There are clearly a lot of political undercurrents at play here.

## MoonPay

Star Atlas announced their latest partnership with MoonPay. This partnership aims to make the metaverse accessible to all individuals worldwide regardless of their knowledge of, and experience with cryptocurrency and games. This enables transactions to be paid with your debit or credit card. For more information about this partnership, read [Star Atlas Partners with MoonPay to Provide an Onramp for Next Wave of Metaverse Citizens](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/star-atlas-partners-with-moonpay-to-provide-an-onramp-for-next-wave-of-metaverse-citizens-301565103.html).

## Showroom Module

Last week, Danny (Chief Product Officer), shared that skins are planned to be part of the full release of the showroom module. Not only that, but they are also working on a proof of concept to include these skins (including custom decals) into SCREAM. 

Regarding the development updates, the team is still busy wrapping everything up for the initial release, with the blockchain department now working on wallet integration. 

Perhaps the highlight of this week was the release of another video clip featuring the [Volant Studio (showroom) at night](https://player.vimeo.com/video/719190821?app_id=122963&h=3f69853b4b)! This time around there was a puzzle that needed to be [solved](https://twitter.com/staratlas/status/1535325432358309888) in order to unlock the release of this video, which required people to keep a close eye at the various social outlets the team is using.

## SCREAM

There have been only a few changes to the roadmap that was published this week. Everything is still firmly in the prototyping (or R&D) phase.

New tidbits that were revealed this week include that, on the blockchain side, the team finished making minor changes to Points program. They also redesigned the Star System program and the Movement program. Meanwhile, the UI team spent time last week on the game HUD and ship management screens.

## Galactic Marketplace

It looks like work is drying up, with the blockchain team awaiting the results from their second audit pass and the UX department remaining focused on helping out the UI engineers. 

These engineers completed the side-bar last week, as well as the switch to real-time mock data. They are currently working on adding the mock data to the UI and then replacing it with actual blockchain data. The team is also refining the "my orders" tab.

## POLIS DAO

The UX department completed the high-fidelity designs, while the UI team converted these designs for the front-end. It looks like this marks the end of the work for the UX specialists! This week the UI team is working on "incorporating adjusted workflow metrics to better estimate the completion date". That sounds interesting, though it's a little unclear what this is exactly about.

Lastly for the blockchain, the ATLAS staking program has been reviewed internally and the Tribeca/Goki audits were completed. Kudelski is now auditing the ATLAS staking program.

## Cosmic Thunder NFT

Those who attended the FTX Miami Beach Race Weekend on-site, or signed up online, were given the promised NFT via airdrop last week. Read [our article](https://aephia.com/star-atlas/airdrop-ftx-miami-attendance-trinket/) for some more details.

## Events

## COPA
