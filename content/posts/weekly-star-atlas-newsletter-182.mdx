This week’s newsletter is on the shorter side, but it’s the calm before the storm! The first Town Hall of the year is set for this Wednesday, and it promises to be action-packed. Additionally, we’ve got DAO updates, a new PIP that’s open for voting, a new show for Builders, and an interesting Atlas Brew!

_Let’s dive in!_

Star Atlas – Town Hall Announcement

## Town Hall – June 4th

The biggest news item, no doubt, though it’s only an announcement: This Wednesday, the team is hosting a Town Hall again! This will be the first Town Hall of the year, following the previous one, which took place on [December 18, 2024](https://aephia.com/star-atlas/town-hall-report-december-18-2024/). The team announced that they will be sharing juicy sneak peeks and getting into detail on upcoming transformational updates happening this year, like:

* SAGE Labs C4 Update: A game-changing update to our browser-based experience featuring Combat, Claim Stakes, Crafting Habs, and Council Rank
* Mid-Year Star Atlas Update: A major milestone for our UE5 experience that introduces early progression systems for the first time
* Holosim: Our free-to-play version of SAGE Labs

Michael (CEO) mentions he can see this running 3 hours easily, but it is likely safe to say to will at least take 2 hours.

Not long ago, Michael shared that they were aiming for mid-July, but it appears something changed, which led to a rescheduling to early June.

## DAO Update

Meanwhile, voting for PIP-15 and PIP-16 has come to an end, resulting in the following:

**[PIP 15: In-Person Community Platform](https://govern.staratlas.com/proposals/bd065ad2-5e75-4e47-a696-a1efe06382da)** — The proposal aims to strengthen the Star Atlas community by facilitating and promoting local connections and events. It will create a website-based platform for organizing Star Atlas community in-person meetups worldwide. The platform will handle event organization, ticketing, and host support, inspired by the Star Citizen community’s “Bar Citizen” initiative. Funding is requested to create the platform for a total of $9540 USD.

**Final Results:** 37.40% For | **_59.79% Against_** | 2.81% Abstain
**Votes cast**: 19.22% (104 / 540 million PVP)

[**PIP-16: Ryden Systems**](https://govern.staratlas.com/proposals/b11ced4b-a6a5-4211-a0e6-060eadc4bd22) — Risingson has been developing Eveeye for 1.5+ years while living off a savings account, providing gaming depth and real economic value to the Star Atlas community for free. While loving working on the tools, he cannot continue without a sustainable income and therefore will convert to a paid system. This funding request supports Eveeye in keeping running until a sustainable income can be generated, hopefully.

****Final Results:** **_75.87% For_** | 6.53% Against | 17.60% Abstain
**Votes cast**: 19.80% (107 / 540 million PVP)

### PIP-17 Open For Voting

Meanwhile, a new PIP has opened up for voting:

**[PIP-17: Star Atlas Ecosystem Media Expansion](https://govern.staratlas.com/proposals/4df4c199-e888-4fdc-a666-7f82d6cf2de7)** — This proposal seeks 10 million ATLAS to begin funding an expansive, DAO-aligned content initiative including short-form video, music integration, educational one-pagers, player engagement, and a professional short film tied to the Star Atlas metaverse over the next four months. All ATLAS will be held within the ecosystem and not converted into USDC. The funding will directly support content creation, in-game activity, and long-term value generation for the DAO.

**Results around time of publication:** 63.55% For | 36.45% Against | 0% Abstain
**Closes:** Thursday, June 12th, end-of-day UTC

## News Bits

Here are a few smaller news bits from the past week:

* The community team had one of ATMTA’s level designers on during last week’s [Atlas Brew](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ4XGCf8t3U) and delved into the process of creating the Gateway map and Paizul’s Arena. If you like a glimpse behind the scenes, then this is definitely worth watching!
* The team had previously organized special [_Builders Hour_ meetings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsNKHEEW86I) on a dedicated server with community builders, but has now opted to make them public to everyone. This past Thursday, the very first of these monthly meetings took place on the Star Atlas Discord. If you are contemplating building on the Star Atlas IP, you should probably mark these meetings in your calendar.
