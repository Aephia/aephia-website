### 🌌 Navigating the Cosmic Currents

_Available in 2 colors_ _(on multiple color shirts)_

> _When the stars dim and the day’s work is done, Aephians gather — not in silence, but in solidarity. Inspired by our shared hours in the Cantina, Cosmic Currents wraps you in soft, meditative comfort, made for the moments between missions._

Perfect for decompressing after long voyages, recharging in our weekly meetings, or connecting with guildmates across the metaverse. This tee channels the quiet strength of interstellar camaraderie.

A big shout-out to **Brutus** for designing all of these shirts! When he submitted the winning design during our merch competition back in February 2022, we knew we had a great designer among us; someone we could trust to shape the future of Aephia’s wearable identity.
