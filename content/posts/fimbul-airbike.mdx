The Fimbul Airbike is the perfect starter ship for the budget conscious space traveler. Even though the oversized impulse engine fitting is using some slightly dated technologies, the Airbike can still perform speeds and distances typical of its class. Fresh off the production line, this ship does not come with stocked weapons, but the hardpoint can be equipped aftermarket to utilize all of its capabilities. Shipcraft engineers tend to fondly recall their first Airbike blueprint that turned them onto the wonders of space flight.

### A fully equipped Generation 1 model

Remember that all ships bought through the GAO ([Galactic Asset Offering](https://staratlaswiki.org/wiki/GAO)), are delivered fully loaded. In later game stages, new ships will be barebone and only limited components are bespoke and fixed. So – you’re not only getting a Generation 1 model, but you’re also getting more bang for your buck!

However, the ships will still be fully customizable. All the various modules can be changed/sold as needed as confirmed by Bunthius (Star Atlas CPO): “_The plan right now is that all GAO ships come with filled crew/component/module slots. You’ll be able to un-slot all these GAO filler items and sell them, and respec individually._”

### Earning potential of the Fimbul Airbike

If you’re wondering how much you can earn with your Fimbul Airbike in Star Atlas, here are some facts:

Before Star Atlas releases the full game in the Unreal 5 engine, all players have the opportunity to participate in the browser game (called SCORE) with their ship NFTs to generate revenue (learn all the details about the [Star Atlas mini game](https://aephia.com/star-atlas/what-is-the-star-atlas-mini-game-score/) in our guide).

If the player provides his ship to his faction (ONI, MUD or Ustur), he will receive ATLAS, the in-game currency of Star Atlas, in return. This amount is measured by the **VWAP** (the “volume weighted average price” at which the ship was offered in the Galactic Asset Offering) of your ships. For the Fimbul Airbike the VWAP is **$16,50** USDC.

So if you have the opportunity to buy this ship at a price below the VWAP, this could be a good deal for you (of course no financial or ship advice).

### Aephia Rating

The Fimbul Airbike might not look like the most exciting space vehicle, but upon closer inspection we can see that its oversized engine makes it one of the fastest xx-small ships in this category. Yet – there is no weapon slot! If the announcement of the devs comes true, that the Airbike can be outfitted later with a weapon, this little bugger becomes an interesting gamble.
