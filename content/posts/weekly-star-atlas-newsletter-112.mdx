For the first newsletter for the year, we want to kick things off by wishing you a Happy New Year and a 2024 of galactic proportions! Team members have previously mentioned that 2024 will be the year of Star Atlas, and we’ll make sure to keep you updated on all developments through this newsletter! We certainly believe the potential is there!

Meanwhile, the team has resumed their work, but -as expected- not many newsworthy items were shared. The team has undoubtedly kicked off internal planning for the new year like they did in previous ones. Fortunately, three weeks is a long time, so we managed to gather some interesting news bits for you below!

Let’s dive in!

Star Atlas – Multiplayer Stress Test #1

## Showroom Multiplayer Stresstest

No doubt the highlight of last week: The team announced their first Showroom Multiplayer test! 

For 24 hours, the team will update the game client on the Epic Game Store, allowing everyone to participate easily. The test will go live on January 17th, 17:00 UTC (12:00 ET), and the team hopes to get a good many people to participate. They hope to get 1000 concurrent players in the game during this 24-hour window.

If you cannot join this time, do not worry. In the near future, the team will host more of these!

## UE5 – A Glimpse into the Future

On the day the team started their holiday, Brad Warren (Gameplay Engineer) dropped a [9-minute video](https://youtu.be/x_msEcJddhE?si=V1pUrZ5t0m7-5JxS) showing some of his off-hour work on interstellar transitions in UE5\. Michael (CEO) [shared this with the whole world on X.com](https://x.com/at_mwagner/status/1738476617931096391?s=20), so there is a good chance you’ve seen this already. It is looking quite good for what is essentially just a tech demo.

Though Brad mentions that the team may ultimately use a different solution (tech), as he is not happy with the one he used there, this video provides a great behind-the-scene glimpse of what the game will one day be able to offer. If you have somehow not seen this, this video is an _**absolute must-watch**_!

## Unofficial VR-mode

Right after the new year had started, a tool to [add VR support to Unreal Engine games](https://www.uploadvr.com/praydogs-uevr-mod/) (V4.8+) was made available for free by a 3rd party developer. Praydog’s [Universal Unreal Engine VR Mod](https://github.com/praydog/UEVR) (UEVR) basically forces the game to enable Unreal Engine’s built-in VR rendering capability, and hooks directly into the camera, player controller, and weapons.

Though the tool is free, it requires some time to set up correctly. It’s also not a perfect solution for each UE5 game, but one can get quite far with some tweaking.

This last bit is exactly what team member Brad Warren did. And not only that, [he made a video about it](https://youtu.be/r77ShUVo16o) so you can try this at home too!

_With these two awesome videos under his belt, we hope to see many more from Brad in 2024!_

## NeoSwap Partnership

The team has partnered with NeoSwap to lower the threshold for new players to enter the game. NeoSwap, still in beta, asks its users to choose a token (SOL, USDC, or ATLAS) and then offers them a few different asset bundles they deem fitting. It’s unclear what their algorithm bases these packages on (if anything). However, the result is a number of package options, ranging from cheap to quite expensive, consisting of ships and R4 to use them.

NeoSwap – Star Atlas Starter Packs

What makes this service interesting is that it actively checks the Galactic Marketplace to get the current (and best) prices and allows the user to buy the whole package straight from their website.

## Small Newsbits

Below we’ve gathered some of the smaller bits of news, which are well worth your attention.

* The team removed the sales fee for the _Council RFR_ asset, meaning you now get the full 2 ATLAS when selling them to the Star Atlas DAO account.
* Many people encounter issues on the Galactic Marketplace or when dealing with the ATLAS/POLIS Lockers. In short, this is due to congestion of the chain (and the program) pushing up the (priority) fees. However, many applications on Solana do not yet support priority fees, including the aforementioned ones from the team. As a result, most wallets attempt the transaction without this fee added, resulting in failing transactions.
* Claiming POLIS rewards from the POLIS Lockers did not work for a bit, as the team had to replenish the POLIS on the account that stores these earnings. Meanwhile, this has been solved so that everyone can claim their rewards again.

Star Atlas – Armstrong IMP

## Armstrong IMP Sale

Before they went on their break, in response to the 50%-discounted tranches selling out, the team added a new batch of Armstrong IMP (capital ship) ships to the Galactic Marketplace. This time they lowered the discount to 25%.

On January 15th, 17:00 UTC (right before the publication of this newsletter), the team ended this special holiday sale, removing the discounted batch from their marketplace.

During this special sales window, the team sold only _one_ Armstrong IMP. Though more ships changed hands, most sales happened on the secondary market. With the strong referral incentives and self-referrals going on, a good few people who bought the IMP ship previously managed to easily undercut the team’s new offer while still making a profit for themselves.

### Armstrong IMP Tap

In other related news, the Armstrong IMP Tap tranch offered by the team has completely sold out. Though the USDC side had already been sold out for a good bit, the ATLAS side still had a good many on offer. The devaluation of the ATLAS token made that offer more lucrative, however, leading to the number declining steadily over the past few weeks. When there were about 75 remaining on Sunday, January 14th, an individual bought 50 IMP TAP ships in one go, kickstarting the final race to the bottom. In less than an hour, no more discounted TAPs were available from the team.

## Sneak Peeks

During the 2-week hiatus of the team, their Twitter account did share some never-before-seen imagery, which we collected below:
