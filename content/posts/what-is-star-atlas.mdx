Star Atlas is a space-themed strategy game set in the distant future of the year 2620\. It is also a culmination of blockchain, technology, and gaming. We’re here at Aephia are a Decentralised Autonomous Corporation in Star Atlas. You’re probably thinking you’ve never heard those words before, so let me start by explaining what Star atlas is.

You might have heard the words, Bitcoin or blockchain before. Maybe even “magic internet money”. Technology is evolving at an unprecedented rate, where it is now integrating into the gaming industry. Star Atlas is a culmination of blockchain, technology, and gaming. This new combination gives rise to a new concept called the MetaVerse. We were here first before facebook decided to name itself Meta.

In this guide, I’m going to take you through Star Atlas, starting with the trailer, the game overview, what play to earn is, what are NFT’s and we’ll end with a few things for you to do as well To start thigns off, you should know non of this is financial advice, it is educational in nature. Okay with that out of the way let’s watch the trailer, so you can get a sense of what the game is about:

Wasn’t that awesome!? Let me tell you a bit more and give you the grand overview of Star Atlas. Star Atlas is a multifaceted grand strategy real-time game of space exploration, conquest, political intrigue, and more. Star Atlas is a virtual gaming metaverse based in the year 2620\. In this distant future, three major factions have emerged:

* (1) The **MUD** Territory governed by humankind
* (2) The **ONI** Region as a consortium of alien races
* (3) The **Ustur** Sector controlled by sentient androids.

These factions are in an ongoing struggle for resources, territorial conquest, and political domination. You, a faction citizen of Star Atlas, will have the ability to influence the outcome of this intergalactic conflict while creating the opportunity to earn rewards for your contributions.

The metaverse introduces a unique gaming experience through the combination of both traditional core games and blockchain mechanics. It will be a Serverless Massively Multiplayer Online Game using the Solana Blockchain Built on Unreal Engine 5 using Nanite graphics technology that makes cinema-quality real-time environments possible.

## Play to earn

Now that you know a little bit about the game, Let’s talk about play to earn. There are four unique asset pillars to the economy of Star Atlas. All of them are represented both on-chain and in-game in some form:

* Land ownership NFTs
* Monetary assets (ATLAS and POLIS, implemented as tokens)
* In-game items (ships, equipment, crew, ship components, buildings, and blueprints, food)
* In-game resources (fungible assets that are produced by miners and consumed by production)

Star Atlas provides a unique opportunity for players to extract in-game virtual earnings into real-world income. Digital assets owned always belong to the holder, and crypto assets earned can be converted into fiat currencies friction-free. Star Atlas has two fungible tokens that fuel all operations: [POLIS](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/star-atlas-polis/) and [ATLAS](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/star-atlas/). Players can earn these tokens as in-game rewards.

## Star Atlas NFTs

NFTs are Non-Fungible Tokens. Tokenized in-game assets. Players will be able to accumulate all in-game assets as NFTs that can be traded and sold on the [Star Atlas Marketplace](https://play.staratlas.com/market) creating real value and ownership to the player. Non-fungible tokens obtained and traded within Star Atlas create an economy that replicates the tangibility of real-world assets and ownership.
