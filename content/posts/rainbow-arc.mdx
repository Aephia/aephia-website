The Rainbow Arc embodies the highest attainable manufacturing practices to the known Star Atlas metaverse. Utilizing Photoli light levitation, the paneling of the Arc allows for facile transportation of cargo and personnel movements, ship chassis integrity and active defensive hull security. A generous cargo hold makes for economically effective freighting while the crew quarters accommodate luxurious and tranquil long haul creature comforts.

### Manufactured by the Photoli

Rainbow ships are manufactured with the help of the “Photoli”, an ancient race of light-based creatures and the source of extremely advanced technology. They can be found throughout the galaxy and have their own mysterious agenda.

Their technology is described as “exotic”, compared to the military, stealth, or civilian focus of the major factions. The description of those ships on the marketplace often incorporates terms like “revolutionary”, “perfection”, “masterpiece” or “perfection.”

Rainbow ships are made of all the nine major resources that are spread across all regions of the Star Atlas – but also incorporate rare materials that can only be found in the high-risk zone.

If you ever want to build a Rainbow ship yourself, you will need the respective blueprint. How to get one? You will need to get in a manufacturer’s good graces: You will have to prove that both your interests are aligned and/or that you’re supporting them. In in-game terms, you will need to gain loyalty (aka reputation) with them, before they judge you worthy of building ships with their logo on them (accruing loyalty won’t be possible before the SCORE v1 and CREAM v1 modules have been released).

Gaining loyalty with the Photoli requires completing their missions. Unlike the minor factions (Jorvik, ECOS & Tufa), there is no initiation required. However, how and where you can get these missions remains a mystery! You can learn more about shipbuilding and blueprints in our [in-depth guide](https://aephia.com/star-atlas/star-atlas-shipbuilding-blueprints-loyalty/).

### A fully equipped Generation 2 model

Remember that all ships bought through the GAO ([Galactic Asset Offering](https://staratlaswiki.org/wiki/GAO)), are delivered fully loaded. In later game stages, new ships will be barebone and only limited components are bespoke and fixed. So – you’re not only getting a Generation 2 model, but you’re also getting more bang for your buck!

However, the ships will still be fully customizable. All the various modules can be changed/sold as needed as confirmed by Bunthius (Star Atlas CPO): “_The plan right now is that all GAO ships come with filled crew/component/module slots. You’ll be able to un-slot all these GAO filler items and sell them, and respec individually._”

### Earning potential of the Rainbow Arc

If you’re wondering how much you can earn with your Rainbow Arc in Star Atlas, here are some facts:

Before Star Atlas releases the full game in the Unreal 5 engine, all players have the opportunity to participate in the browser game (called SCORE) with their ship NFTs to generate revenue (learn all the details about the [Star Atlas mini game](https://aephia.com/star-atlas/what-is-the-star-atlas-mini-game-score/) in our guide).

If the player provides his ship to his faction (ONI, MUD or Ustur), he will receive ATLAS, the in-game currency of Star Atlas, in return. This amount is measured by the **VWAP** (the “volume weighted average price” at which the ship was offered in the Galactic Asset Offering) of your ships. For the Rainbow Arc, the VWAP is **$13,721** USDC.

So if you have the opportunity to buy this ship at a price below the VWAP, this could be a good deal for you (of course no financial or ship advice).
