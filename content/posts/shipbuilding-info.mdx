We have some information regarding ship building from Michael Wagner (Star Atlas CEO). The time requirement will differ depending on the size of the ship/item. Mega projects will likely take quite a long time by default, but can potentially be sped up through additional contributions. He also added that “_All resources will be required, though we might break it out so that segments of a ship can be built and combined over time_“. In addition to that, large ships could take weeks/months to build. However, this is still being worked on.
