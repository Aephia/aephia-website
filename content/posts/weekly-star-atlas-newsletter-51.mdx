_Welcome to our 51st newsletter on Star Atlas! This is a weekly newsletter, published by Aephia Industries, that is focused entirely on Star Atlas. Here we try to aggregate all the newsworthy tidbits that were dropped by the team throughout the past week._

Last week was very light on news with no Atlas Star, no Townhall, and no content drop. With the team's progress reports being shared once every three weeks nowadays via their Atlas Star newsletter, hopefully, more information will be available again next week!

Solana Breakpoint is coming up though!

## Breakpoint 2022

On November 4th, the Solana Foundation is organizing a Games Day where a bunch of games building on Solana will demonstrate/present their (upcoming) game and allow visitors to experience them. Star Atlas will be present that day, hosting a 45-minute game demo with 8 players competing in a pre-release version of Showroom R2.

Additionally, Michael Wagner (CEO) will present a keynote during the [Solana Breakpoint](https://solana.com/breakpoint/agenda) event and the team will be part of a tech breakout session on *chain architecture*. If you're there, make sure to also visit the team's booth in the Game Stadium!

Dominic (Community Manager) shared that there will be a few *interesting* Star Atlas surprises as well.

All in all, even if you are not interested in the development of the Solana chain, keep your eyes peeled for the Star Atlas Breakpoint footage!

## Community Meetup - Lisbon

Knowing that many Star Atlas fans will be in Lisbon for the Solana Breakpoint event it presents the perfect opportunity to organize the first-ever global community meetup there at that time. 

For that reason, on November 6th, community members will gather in Lisbon (location TBA) to talk about their passion over drinks and some bites. Santi (Community Director) has confirmed that he will be present as well!

Note that this is a low-key community-organized event, that is not supported or sponsored in any way by the team. This means that the drinks and food won't be for free, but the good vibes and camaraderie will be!

For more information and to stay up to date, check out the **#meetup-lisbon** channel on the official Star Atlas discord server!

## Picture of the week

The [Star Atlas Community Twitter account](https://twitter.com/wearestaratlas) has started to highlight community-made Volant Studio screenshots on their account. Every week the Community team selects a screenshot they like best and shares that as the *Picture of the Week*.
