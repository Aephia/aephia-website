The Star Atlas team is planning to release the ship-building mechanic earlier than expected as part of CREAM ([see updated roadmap](https://staratlas.notion.site/CREAM-Mining-Crafting-TIER-0-4e31f9f1a3a843b0a9227ccc7085f034)). The idea here is specifically to delegate the creation of XXS ships to the community, so there will be enough of them. With whales being able to buy up the whole supply of newly released XXS ships in short time, the team is looking into this to make sure there will be a constant supply of ships for beginners.

Michael Wagner, CEO of Star Atlas confirmed right away that:

* creating ships costs resources and time
* additional ships will be able to be player-created further down the line
* all current ships will eventually be able to be created by players
