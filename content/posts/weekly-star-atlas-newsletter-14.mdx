## Ship news

The past week saw the release of the first ship of 2022, the [Fimbul Airbike](https://play.staratlas.com/market/5xdJFqr5Au4kgGpfoQz9u1fpHhTWoHi4smRB1xxMM4CN)! Its total supply is 375.000, which is more than the original supply for Pearce X4’s and Opal Jet’s combined. This is in line with statements made earlier, where the team announced that the supply for each ship released this year would be higher than for equivalent ships launched last year.

With this release, we've also learned how the team will divide new ship releases over the ATLAS and USDC markets going forward. Unlike late last year, when the supply of new ships was split 50/50 over the USDC and ATLAS markets, all ships sold this year will see [80% of its supply be made available on the ATLAS](https://aephia.com/star-atlas/new-ships-supply-in-a-80-20-ratio-pro-atlas/) market, with the remaining 20% being available for purchase with USDC.

Lastly, Danny (CPO) mentioned that the team has over 140 ship models in production at the moment. Of these, 24 have been sold last year and 51 are scheduled for sale for this year, which leaves the team with around 65 new ship models we might see released in 2023 and beyond.

## Brochure

Two weeks ago it was announced that 51 new ship lines would be going up for sale throughout 2022. With the first sale having started during the past week, many people have been wondering if a brochure was going to be be released to the community, similar to the one distributed for the first GAO phase.

We’ve learned since that not all relevant ship statistics, including their names, have been finalized just yet, making a the release of brochure at this time impossible. However, a release might be forthcoming in a couple of weeks.

## Crew & Components

As most of you will know, all ships sold in the past and the near future do include their default modules, components and crew members as well. When ship-configuration is officially launched, this will no longer be the case. Ships sold after that date will be sold without crew, and potentially without any components.

## POLIS DAO

Last year, the team mentioned they were working with an unannounced 3rd party on its POLIS DAO solution for staking & governance. At some point, this third party had created a solution in Solidity (Ethereum chain) that they then had to port to Solana. After the recent setback (see the previous newsletter), this week it was revealed that the team is looking to use one of the Solana native solutions that have been created in the meantime. The team has not yet made a decision yet on which solution they might adopt, but expect this to happen later this week.

## Short tidbits

- Two Faction passes are needed to gain access to both other factions
- The team once more confirmed that the placeholder launch dates (countdowns really) for land-based structures on the Galactic Marketplace are indeed just that, placeholders. These countdowns will be updated before CREAM Tier 0 is released to reflect their actual availability.
