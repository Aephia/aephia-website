_Welcome to our 58th newsletter on Star Atlas! This weekly newsletter is published by Aephia Industries and focuses entirely on Star Atlas. Here we try to aggregate all the newsworthy tidbits that were dropped by the team throughout the past week._

As we rolled from the second into the third week of the Start Sequence campaign, ships offered by the team have remained on their shelves. This does not come as s surprise, as the team has been reducing the discounts week after week.

Like last week, all eyes are still set on the upcoming land sales, which now have gotten an official launch date of **December 20th**, and the SAGE Game Manual that is being worked on by Chip (Game Systems Designer) should go live a little earlier.

Another topic that kept people talking during the last week was the outcome of the Joni Award nominations. Given that official news more or less dried up, let's start there!

## CORE - Issue 2

Last Wednesday, December 7th, the second issue of the CORE Graphic Novel was published on both Magic Eden and the Galactic Marketplace. Like last time, both platforms offer their own unique collectible cover.

The issue is being sold at 1.5 SOL over at [Magic Eden](https://magiceden.io/sft/ABAsXY1MFBxotFCJXWn8pHzdf6jWy3rzXYekLmWYjXSH?name=Core---Episode-2-(Magic-Eden)), roughly the equivalent of $20. As we suggested during our [previous newsletter](https://intel.aephia.com/newsletters/weekly-star-atlas-newsletter-57/), the team has decided to offer start offering this new issue for 20 USDC on the [Galactic Marketplace](https://play.staratlas.com/market/GxoC3qAy3j1gjYZuGhVh8ufdJKGn2HJeiRjJ9XpikR8v) instead of its ATLAS equivalent.

Like always, the new issue can be read for free via most big e-book publishers (such as [Apple](https://books.apple.com/nl/book/star-atlas-core/id6444965231?l=en)).

![Star Atlas - DAO Dark Mode](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/86b7f779afe8d449aa2a6c1920d9dbdd13da0fe0b4067a9659dc6072a5dd9d5a.png)

## News Tibits

## DAO

The team has launched an update for their [DAO portal](https://govern.staratlas.com/ ) that came with the following features:
- Interface updates
- Bug fixes
- Dark Mode

## Other
- The team will go on a holiday break on December 21st.
- Leaderboards for R2 won't be on-chain, meaning the UE5 experience will remain playable without requiring any Solana transactions (costing SOL)
- You will be able to name fleets in SAGE. These names won't be unique, so that multiple players can have similarly named fleets.
