_Welcome to our 19th newsletter! Contrary to the fully packed newsletter of last week, this one turned out a lot leaner._

## DAO

Here are some updates from the latest Roadmap Report.
- Interactive wireframe testing is currently ongoing.
- [Tribeca](https://tribeca.so/)/[Goki](https://goki.so/): [Marinade.finance](https://marinade.finance/) audit is in progress.

## Showroom

Altered technology design in the showroom module for interactive elements to Photoli-MUD integrated tech design. The applies to:
- Ship summoning terminals
- Character teleportation pads
- General interactive panels for elevators and hangar doors
- The Meta-holobox

The [Roadmap Report](https://staratlas.notion.site/Roadmap-Report-8e75d87c5b7b4a67afb4fd776d6c3176) of March 4 came with some new images from the showroom module. The community has been clamoring to see more Showroom visuals, but Danny explained that their partner, Sperasoft has to approve any images shared, and they are very reluctant to share images of the unfinished product. The SA team is understandably respectful of their wishes. Furthermore, Danny shared that they are building up a character creation tool from the ground up, that will support multiple races and body archetypes in addition to facial animation. They have talent working on this from ILM, Riot, Blizzard and Respawn Entertainment. Until that module is done, we will keep seeing footage with the UE5 mannequin.

## SCREAM

The team is currently busy prototyping the game design in WebGL and on the blockchain.

Besides ATLAS, NFTs such as components for ships- could also end up being rewarded for SCREAM missions.

The team confirmed that SCORE will be phased out once SCREAM is launched. This means that rewards and economic structures will be reconfigured based on SCREAM gameplay. Passive earning mechanics from SCORE will slowly be discontinued over time.

While SCORE is still online, you will have to choose in which module you want to use your ships. You can not use ships in SCREAM that are still enlisted in SCORE. You will have to delist them in order to use them.

## Risk Zones

This week, there was a lot of discussion again, based on information shared in the [document on Risk Zones](https://staratlas.notion.site/Risk-Zones-Public-88fb5c12fd1145988443c2bf616174c3) that the team released over a week ago. It’s clear that the insurance system is still very much in flux. Many community members did respond favorably to the Bounty system, after Chypto clarified some of the outstanding questions. To make sure everybody can easily stay up to date, we compiled all this information into our [Bounty system guide](https://aephia.com/star-atlas/star-atlas-bounties-101/).

## Ships

The past week saw the release of two new ships, the [Fimbul Lowbie](https://play.staratlas.com/market/8nqjw5UVN65GyfdqiXnfJNbDVBgbk8RpFFd7uACXenbx) and the [Rainbow Arc](https://play.staratlas.com/market/287f9V8JReL3bXhQsM6CPb5C5ARcxCMLygLajN9iUsMZ). Due to current market-conditions there are still plenty available for purchase!

Michael clarified that all ships being released this year will see between a 2-3x increased base supply. This is in preparation for user growth numbers this year and beyond.

Lastly, the Rainbow Arc price turned out to be higher than the range published in the GAO Wave 2 brochure. According to Michael the range published is the base-range, and it does not take into account the premium/discount modifiers that have been assigned to each of the manufacturers. They will rectify this and release an updated brochure.
