In responding to a question in the Foundation Room, Star Atlas CPO, Danny Floyd, confirmed that “_skill progression trees are linked with specific missions within that role. So you complete the missions to upgrade those trees. Ambient XP outside of missions is for individual crew onboard who are performing skills and upgrading their individual stats only go towards those crew members, not your overall role-based progression linked to skill trees. This will be really clear once phase 2 of ship missions comes online in the mini-game, and even more_ \[clear\] _with phase 3._“
