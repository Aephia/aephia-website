Michael Wagner, CEO of Star Atlas, revealed some details in an [interview](https://youtu.be/ief7G1DlIoI?t=892) with DDN about the ships that were not sold on the open market as part of the Galactic Asset Offering, but were instead sent directly to individual wallets via airdrop. Wagner quantified these sales as “early access purchases.”

“The minimum (to qualify for the coordination of such purchases) right now is a three million dollar purchase. There are no discounts being provided. The benefit is that people are getting access to wave one of the tranche without having to complete on the open market.”

However, he also pointed out that these sales are limited: “The responsibility we have is to ensure that we’re not distributing too many of the assets that are intended to go onto the market through this early access process.”

To streamline this process in the future, the Star Atlas team is looking to hire a “[Head of DAC relations](https://aephia.com/star-atlas/head-of-dac-relations/)” for all guilds that want to structure a portfolio in that way.
