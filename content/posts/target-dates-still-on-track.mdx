Due to Thanksgiving, the update of the official Star Atlas roadmap, which was actually planned for every Friday, had been moved to Monday. Now the team published details about the current progress.

The most important point for us investors: SCORE and POLIS staking are still on schedule for early December. Namely, December 8 was given as the target date for the mini game and December 9 for POLIS staking.

Further details on this schedule are to be announced next Friday – most likely at the Town hall or as part of the next roadmap update.
