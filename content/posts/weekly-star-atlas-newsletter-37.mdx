## Official news

Star Atlas released an article - [How to Prepare for the Upcoming Galactic Marketplace Upgrade](https://medium.com/star-atlas/how-to-prepare-for-the-upcoming-galactic-marketplace-upgrade-6eb03d060bb8) to guide players in anticipation of the Galactic Marketplace upgrade. Players are advised to delist all buy and sell orders. Additionally, once the new Galactic Marketplace goes live, ATMTA will relist assets sold by them with updated ATLAS prices, re-pegging them to the current ATLAS value in USDC. This means that when the new Marketplace comes up, almost all ships offered by the team, from GAO Phase 2, will cost more in ATLAS than they do now, due to the declining value of ATLAS vs USDC since the assets originally were put on the market.

The team also released the 13th issue of the Roadmap Scan - [The Sogmian and The Proposal — Roadmap Scan #13](https://medium.com/star-atlas/the-sogmian-and-the-proposal-roadmap-scan-13-a59f9f96f2f0).

## 426LIVE

The much anticipated #426LIVE event will take place on July 21 at 1:00 pm EDT on the official [Star Atlas Discord](http://discord.gg/StarAtlas).

## Assets

Shula (Tech Lead and Game Design) clarified that owning a GAO ship will not award players with any blueprint based on the current game design. It is likely that blueprints will be unlocked through a combination of the Tech skill tree and LP/ATLAS spending. He reiterated that the Tech skill tree is complex and will take players a considerable amount of time to reach a “leaf”. 

Michael (CEO) revealed that there are around 75 ship models in the art pipeline that will be sold after this year’s GAO Phase 2.

## Showroom Module

Last week's development update starts by mentioning that the art team has identified the final list of improvements and that they are now applying those finishing touches. Meanwhile, the blockchain team has been working on updating the wallet integration. Finally, the gameplay team invested time into performance fine-tuning.

## SCREAM

Chip (Director of Game Systems Design) clarified that ships within fleets will share their aggregate R4 capacity with one another, meaning they will all consume from the same pooled resources. That means when you add any R4 to a ship in the fleet, all ships will benefit from that.

## Progress

The Game economics team has defined the SCREAM macro-economy and sub-economies to determine all their dependencies. Also, the Web team has been building out the movement and cargo functionality, plus they spent time implementing various UI elements.

In an interesting turn of events, Game Design shifted back to the Prototyping phase, whereas they only recently moved to "Building". We'll probably have to wait until next week to see if this was a fluke, or if they went back to the experimentation phase.

## Galactic Marketplace

The team is ready to launch! As per the article mentioned above, the new and improved marketplace will see its release this **Thursday, July 21st**!

## POLIS DAO

It looks like the POLIS Locker is done as well. Front-end finalized the locker manager, while the Economics team finalized the reward emissions. The only thing remaining, scheduled for this week is the actual deployment of the contracts to the chain.

It's getting very close! Chances are this will go live on the 21st as well *(speculation)*!

## Finance

Michael (CEO) clarified that the team is looking for a way to automate the recalibrating of ATLAS prices of ships on a defined interval. He added that the team will reprice the ships again if the price of ATLAS would go too far up.

## Ships

A new ship has been announced, which will be released this Thursday, during the 426LIVE event. This will mark the first ship ever to have been released straight to the new and improved Galactic Marketplace!
