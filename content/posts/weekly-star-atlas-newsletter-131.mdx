_Welcome to our 131st newsletter on Star Atlas! This weekly newsletter, published by Aephia Industries, focuses entirely on the development of this ambitious game. Here, we try to aggregate all the newsworthy tidbits revealed \[mainly by the team\] throughout the past week._

Another, mostly uneventful, week has passed. But the few things that did happen were certainly enticing to Starbased players! The team re-introduced ship redemptions in SAGE and, on top, introduced ATLAS Emission _bonuses_ based on Starbased Tier upgrades. And two more great changes are scheduled to go live this week!

We’ll go over all of these changes in detail, but we’re kicking things off with another event that got people talking: The release of the Crew passenger capacity for each ship. Finally, we’ll wrap up this issue with some of the latest sneak peeks the team shared during the past week. And we’ve got a special bonus: _new Rainbow Phi concept art_!

_Let’s dive in!_

## Ship Passenger Capacity

With Crew arriving next month and players eager to put them to work in Starbased, the community has been anxious to learn more about the _transport_ capabilities of the various ships. The wait is over! Chip (Director of Game Systems Design) updated the [Ship Stats spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cfzW3uiqkbnfJexBysh0MAzZYRhiRwQg8WlsFWfuKgs/edit#gid=205337066) with a new passenger capacity column for all ships. Passenger modules have been taken into account, and allegedly, the team doubled the base capacity for all _transport_\-specced ships.

The first observation is that, as expected based on earlier comments, small ships do not have any spare capacity to ferry crew members around. The smallest _transport_ ships available are the following three:

* Fimbul Lowbie
* Ogrika Niruch
* Calico Maxhog

These three Extra Small (XS) ships each require (and come with) 2 crew and offer a single passenger seat. The next available options are in the Medium size range, with the following two standing out:

* Calico Compakt Hero \[Multi-Role\] – **9 passengers** (1 passenger module)
* Calico Evac \[Rescue\] – **12 passengers** (2 passenger modules)

Medium Data Runners, Freighters, and Mining ships have been given some base passenger space as well:

* Rainbow Om – **4 passengers**
* VZUS opod – **4 passengers**
* Fimbul BYOS Ranger – **4 passengers**
* Fimbul BYOS Packlite – **4 passengers**
* Armstrong IMP Tap – **4 passengers**

Every Large ship has at least a base passenger capacity of 14, every Capital has a base value of 50 passengers, and every command ship can ferry around an additional 172 passengers. Titans offer the most space, with all of them having the capacity for 3519 passengers \[a significant leap due to all of them coming with 2 passenger modules\].

Here is a list of every Large+ ship that offers additional passenger space:

* Opal Bitboat \[_Large_ Transport\] – **65 passengers** (4 passenger modules)
* Calico Guardian \[_Capital_ Multi-Role\] – **129 passengers** (2 passenger modules)
* Ogrika Jod Asteris \[_Capital_ Transport\] – **207 passengers** (4 passenger modules)
* Fimbul ECOS Treearrow \[_Commander_ Bomber\] – **253 passengers** (1 passenger module)

_Note that the team is looking for feedback from players on these updates, so do let them know your thoughts on the Star Atlas Discord!_

### Passenger Modules

The team’s intent is for Passenger modules to be swappable, just like the other modules. That said, there simply is not enough room on XS and XXS ships to fit a passenger module. Additionally, Small and Medium-sized ships may impose limits on the number of Passenger modules that can be installed.

## Starbased: Atlas Bonus Emissions

Two weeks ago, [we shared](https://aephia.com/star-atlas/weekly-star-atlas-newsletter-129/) that the team had made some quick changes to Starbased and planned to roll out a few more impactful updates soon after. This past Saturday, one of those announced updates went live: bonus _ATLAS emissions based on Starbase tier upgrades_. 

Announced on Friday, this update became active starting with the epoch that started on Saturday UTC. Tier 2+ Starbases now grant an additional ATLAS _emission bonus_ to their Faction. Tier 2 Starbases add **7000** ATLAS each, with higher Tier Starbases yielding even bigger bonuses!

## Starbased: Ship Redemption

Making a comeback to SAGE is ship redemption! You can now again redeem components in exchange for one of the following two ships:

* Calico Maxhog (12,447 available in this tranche)
* Fimbul Mamba EX (424 available in this tranche)

Here are the recipes:

The team allocated roughly 15% of the remaining allocation to this first tranche to test the waters. Additional tranches will likely open up in the future, however.

Note that, as can be seen in the above shots, these redemption recipes are **only available at the CSS**. No other Starbase offers them, regardless of their Tier.

## Starbased: Coming This Week

Two updates that did not quite make it due to last-minute issues but are targeted to go out this coming this week (perhaps even this Tuesday) are:

* Crafting speed updates
* Reduced SDU requirements for upgrading Starbases

### Crafting Speed Updates

Two weeks ago, the team shared that Crafting would soon be updated. The proposed change was that crafting would no longer grind to a halt when the Starbase would run out of Food. Instead, it would carry on, albeit at a much slower pace. A second change would link crafting & food consumption speed to the amount of Food supply still available at the Starbase.

We’ve not heard anything about that last part just yet, but _continued crafting at a low **Base speed** when Food has run out_, is about to go live!

One new aspect introduced with this change is that the Base crafting speed is not static across different Starbase tiers. Instead, it will go up with the Starbase tier. In other words, the higher the Tier, the faster the base crafting speed will be. See the list below for the speeds the team settled on for now.

**Starbase _Foodless_ Crafting Efficiency (per tier)**:

* **Tier 1**: 20% of nominal speed
* **Tier 2**: 27.5% of nominal speed
* **Tier 3**: 35% of nominal speed
* **Tier 4**: 42.5% of nominal speed
* **Tier 5 & 6**: 50% of nominal speed

This results in a 1-minute crafting job taking 5 minutes when a Tier 1 Starbase has run out of Food. At Tier 5 Starbases and at the CSS, this job would take 2 minutes, twice as long as it would when Food would have been supplied.

This will be a huge boon to _smaller_ players, who no longer have to follow bigger players around to ensure they are crafting at a Starbase that has sufficient Food provided to it. The CSS has now become a whole lot more interesting (for them) as well, as the high Food cost previously kept players from wanting to do their crafting there.

### Reduced SDU Requirements

With the overhaul of the SDU mechanics in mid April, the SDU requirements to upgrade Starbases to the next Tier went up as well, and by a considerable amount. Players needed to deposit 20x more SDUs to go from Tier 2 to Tier 3 than before. Tier 4 and 5 were equally affected, but due to Tier 2 upgrades already ongoing, the team could not update the Tier 2 requirements, so they stayed at 3.4 million SDUs.

Now, the team has decided to lower the SDU requirements based on actual data from the past few weeks. However, as many Starbases are being upgraded to Tier 3 at the moment, this would prevent the team from lowering the requirement for that Tier.

Fortunately, the team managed to find a way around this. So, in conclusion, if all goes well, the SDU requirements for T3+ upgrades should soon drop substantially!

It’s not yet clear if the team will take this opportunity to update the T2 SDU requirements (increasing the number of SDUs required) while they’re at it.

## Sneak Peeks

Last week, we were treated with in-engine shots of the Calico Maxhog vehicle and in-engine ship-weapons. And we managed to unearth even more Rainbow Phi artwork!
