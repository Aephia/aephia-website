Best described by Santiago Accomo (Star Atlas Marketing and Community Coordinator) aka Santiacc:

“Star Atlas operates a dual token economy, with the two crypto-native assets being ATLAS and POLIS. ATLAS is the transactional currency of the game. Effectively the in-game gold, and the lubricant of the digital economy. It is used for virtually every transaction within the Metaverse, and will also be one of the primary financial reward mechanisms for gamers. ATLAS also provides a 33% discount on certain asset purchases from us, the developer, such as Ships and Components.

POLIS is a dual-purposed governance token. Within the game, POLIS provides the holder with strategic benefits of political domination. Controlling a region of space opens up mechanics of taxation of other players, and the ability to define rules, laws, fines and fees within the micro-metropolis. Externally, POLIS provides holders with true governance rights over long-term development decision making. Opening up the potential for pure decentralization of game development in the years to follow. And naturally, POLIS provides a 33% discount on Land and Crew when purchased from us . The governance token, POLIS, will also play a pivotal role in the decentralized corporations. We anticipate these micro-metropolises to be largely guided by voting abilities of the underlying players. The extent to which a guild wants to utilize that functionality in their decision making is subjective, but the tools are present.”
