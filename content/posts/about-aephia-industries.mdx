Aephia Industries is one of the first and largest Star Atlas guilds (aka _DAC_–Decentralized Autonomous Corporations)! Though our mission is to become the **premier crafter of spaceships** in Star Atlas, our vision reaches much further! When successful, Star Atlas has the best cards to become a major hub in the future metaverse. On our end, we are working hard to become one of the first true metaverse enterprises!

We want to flip the current paradigm on its head and create the organization of the future, that is:

* Fully **Player Governed**
* Fully **Player Owned**
* Creating tools and services that ensure **profits flow to the players**—_not investors—_in a simple, easy-to-understand way.

We believe we have a great game plan for the metaverse that we will execute ethically and transparently! If your interest is piqued, please consider [joining our Discord](https://discord.gg/aephia) to continue this conversation!
