_Welcome to newsletter # 4. This issue mainly focuses on assets, a bit of news regarding ATLAS, and some updates from us!_

## News

A new [article](https://medium.com/star-atlas/star-atlas-in-game-play-adventures-mud-explorer-5449e9483cd8) was released about the MUD faction and space exploration. If you missed the other articles, be sure to read the [USTUR builders](https://medium.com/star-atlas/star-atlas-in-game-play-adventures-ustur-builder-c8d9936331d8) and the [ONI fighters](https://medium.com/star-atlas/star-atlas-in-game-play-conquest-as-an-oni-fighter-ffc94bec9c97).

## Assets

On the topic of crew members, as previously mentioned in our first newsletter, the Star Atlas team is considering realistic human mechanics such as reproduction. To further expand on this topic, offspring will go to university, undergo training, and then be recruited. This will make stations and territories feel more alive. 

On the topic of land, the team confirmed that the supply will be substantially higher and the only visible supply on the website right now are from the [ReBirth rewards](https://play.staratlas.com/events?initialIndex=1). They also confirmed that land stakes are upgradeable. Initially placing a tier 1 claim stake can be replaced by a higher tier claim stake. They are also closely syncing crafting mechanics along with the land release. Lastly, they mentioned that land claims and mining operations are both part of the land sales rollout. 

Speaking of mining, standalone ship mining is a confirmed feature and will be part of a later release. These are specialized ships that focus on the said task. Some ships would even be on par with pure land mining operations and may allow access to exclusive materials. Other rare materials that are outside of one’s faction do not have substitute materials and therefore must be bought or obtained elsewhere.

Moving on to ships, licenses that will be airdropped, will be based on the wallet where the assets reside at the time the snapshot will be taken. The team confirmed that all ships have a charm slot that would mostly be used for cosmetics while others would offer some buffs. As for ship blueprints, these are obtainable from NPCs, RNG-based mission rewards, rewards from epic missions with boss fights, PVP rewards, and potentially when leveling up crafting skills. 

Finally on the topic of assets, they confirmed that one’s ROI is based on the weighted average of a ship’s origination price and not actual market price. This means that buyers who overbid potentially lose their percentage-based ROI. This also means that wave 1 buyers have a slight advantage over wave 2 buyers since the midpoint is considered. In the future, the team will sell on a true bonding curve with incremental price increases on every single ship instead of the stepped price curve that they currently use making the advantages/disadvantages less apparent for any individual buyer.

## Tokens

The team stated that ATLAS does not have a cap and they have always envisioned a perpetual inflation rate in the future, which would begin after emissions are exhausted in 8 years. This is a necessity to maintain the incentive structure for new players. It is up to the DAO to determine the inflation rate.

## Aephia

We just expanded the FAQ channel in our Discord server to address additional topics and concerns. As the game, mechanics, and community evolve, we continue to evaluate our priorities and goals. We, as a leading DAC in Star Atlas, want to accommodate more individuals who share the same goals as us both in and out of the metaverse. If you need further clarification, feel free to contact Prometheus#2401 or Funcracker#7557.

That concludes newsletter #4. Subscribe to get the latest news and connect with us on various social media platforms.
