We had a few quiet weeks now, and last week was no different. However, it looks like the quiet period is coming to an end! The team is planning to launch SAGE Labs this week. This will mark the launch of the very first iterations of Star Atlas’ on-chain gameplay! On top of that, StarPath V2 will be made available this week as well!

Exciting times are ahead, and the content creators in the community will work overtime to produce video tutorials, strategy guides, and other material for you all to benefit from! Finally, we also received some new info on the CORE Act 2 issues and their availability. 

Let’s dive in!

## SAGE Labs

We have a release date! **SAGE Labs will go live on Thursday, September 21st!** 

A second round of playtesting, with an expanded group of playtesters (who could apply this time around, but were ultimately selected by the team), is going on as we publish this, but the team felt confident enough to put out an official release date!

We will be publishing a SAGE Manual at or around the launch of SAGE Labs. Furthermore, a good many content creators are working on video content for SAGE Labs as well, including tutorials and walk-throughs. Do check out our [SAGE Labs Guide](https://aephia.com/star-atlas/sage-labs-a-guide/) in the interim, to make sure you are up to speed!

All in all, though the game is not at all as easy, smooth, or polished as Starbased will be, the content that will be produced by the community will hopefully help many aspiring galactic entrepreneurs on their way!

SAGE Labs – Deposit ships to the Central Space Station \[UI\]

### Ships Rewards

SAGE Labs will offer two avenues to redeem crafted resources and get real spaceships. A few ships will appear on the prize tables for the GoldenTicket raffles. This list will include never-before-seen ships, such as the Fimbul BYOS Butch:

**Fimbul BYOS Butch** (Large)

![butch star atlas 01](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/3a621a28a46d1d0fb513d7f9a6f68dae9c0613586bc8ca7d18124de7babe9521.jpg)

Star Atlas – Fimbul BYOS Butch \[Concept Art\]

> _Description:_ The Butch will trample over challengers without letting you feel anything but the slightest bump… and maybe some panel rattling. Don’t let the overwhelming guns intimidate you. Inside, your crew can find a cozy environment inspired by spartan effectivity.

Furthermore, there will also be ships (of different size classes) that can be redeemed directly, in exchange for a certain amount of crafted input material and SDUs (Survey Data Units). 

Some of these ships _have_ never been sold before by the team, but more importantly, they _**will**_ never be sold by the team. These ships’ entire initial\* supply will be exclusively made available through the redemption process in SAGE Labs. If they do not run out, they may move on to future versions of SAGE.

_\*) Some of these ships have been awarded to StartSequence participants, but none of these ships have ever been sold._ _Also note that **all** ships will be craftable in the future, including the ships made available through the SAGE Labs redemption._

Here are two of the exclusive ships that will be made available:

**Fimbul Mamba EX** (Medium)

![Fimbul H Mamba Parked top front](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/8f2456ee2cb313dd73ddca11520deb5a415db3a999ae5b956b7a800c131842fd.jpg)

Star Atlas – Fimbul Mamba EX \[Concept Art\]

> _Description:_ Intimidation is a lot cheaper than ammunition. When they rebuilt the Mamba into the Mamba EX, Fimbul’s goal was to remind your enemies that things might go better for them if they just raise their hands, instead of their weapons.

**Calico Maxhog** (XX-Small)

![Calico Maxhog](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/19457b399c64acdc9320ac8cc61c09b738e5eb55b21c7b3b81f41846edfac720.webp)

Star Atlas – Calico Maxhog \[Concept Art\]

> _Description:_ Built literally to get away from… everything we could think of—the Maxhog marks Calico’s sporty, aggressive entry into the proper civilian transport market. Equipped above and beyond, the Maxhog features ample cargo space for all your stuff, a roomy cockpit for your most adventurous outing, damage-resistant upholstery, and a thumping high-decibel entertainment system. But with the Calico Maxhog’s staggering VTOL and all-terrain capabilities… seriously, who cares? Whether it’s a ‘spaceship’ or an SUV—it can DRIVE, it can FLY, it can GO UNDERWATER! And we really, really want one!

## Star Path V2

Star Path V2 is about to launch! Last we heard, the completely overhauled Star Path would be launched shortly before the launch of SAGE Labs. That means it is coming this week as well!

We [wrote extensively](https://aephia.com/star-atlas/weekly-star-atlas-newsletter-92/) about the new system’s planned features and inner workings, built on top of BuddyLink, in one of our previous newsletters, and we recommend re-reading that bit to get up to speed. The new version blows the old one straight out of the water!

## Ship Stats V3

Literally minutes before we planned to send out this newsletter, the team published the [third version of their Ship Stats table](https://medium.com/star-atlas/star-atlas-3rd-generation-ship-configuration-system-9c067d2e681).

Here is a [direct link to the spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cfzW3uiqkbnfJexBysh0MAzZYRhiRwQg8WlsFWfuKgs/edit#gid=205337066)! It looks like there are now different tiers of components in play, which should balance things better and -important to many- make sure the VWAP value is accurately represented in each ship. Another important note is that most of the manufacturer bonuses apply to the component itself now.

One of the biggest reveals here: There will be no such thing as ship hulls that need components in order to become flyable, as was the case previously. Instead, all ships come with Tier 0 components that are not removable (but higher tier components can be slotted “over” them). This means every ship crafted can be taken out for a spin right away! 

## CORE Graphic Novel

![CORE8SA](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/56b003033341d9652b9cf59f78ca83098df621fdde0678064fa0c6e7b0f58d78.webp)

CORE – Issue 8 (Act 2 – Issue 2)

Last week, on Wednesday, the team published issue #8 of the CORE Graphic Novel, aka the second episode of Act 2! The new issue is available for free on the [website](https://play.staratlas.com/comic/core/?episode=1&edition=standard&language=en-US), and you can, of course, purchase the [special cover NFT](https://play.staratlas.com/market/C8SAdDCVdtHEenR1qxFq5zMHwvRKN5bpzbguiah4CWYL/) on the Galactic Marketplace as well for 20 USDC.

Previously, you would also have been able to read the comic for free on free e-readers, such as Apple Books. Unfortunately, the team is no longer putting in the time and effort to publish these there. Michael had the following to say on this:

> \[…\] we have dropped support for all e-readers at this time. Our viewership consisted of 300 downloads maximum per episode across all readers, so we have removed support until we can justify the allocation of time/resources to releasing there.
> 
> Michael

On top of this, the second special cover is also not available on MagicEden just yet. All previous issues appeared on Magic Eden on the same day as they appeared on the Galactic Marketplace. Michael had the following to say on this:

> The issue with Episode 8 (Act 2 / ep 2), is on the Magic Eden side, and whether or not they are going to continue supporting SFT sales. I will be chatting with their team tomorrow in an attempt to maintain support through the rest of CORE. Should that fail, despite having a contract with them, we will explore alternatives.
> 
> Michael

Lastly, previously, the team also published the CORE Graphic Novel issues in non-English languages. Unfortunately, the team has stopped doing so in an effort to save time and costs.

If demand is there, the team may still provide these translations at a later time. The same goes for publication on the free e-readers.

## Never Alone

During the last Atlas Brew, it was shared that the deadline for Never Alone: Mission 2 has been extended. Originally, the second mission was supposed to end last week, but instead, it will remain open until the launch of SAGE Labs. This means that this Thursday is most likely the day Mission 2 officially ends.

Of course, like Mission 1 before it, the quests from Mission 2 will remain available to complete while Mission 3 is running. We don’t have the official launch date of Mission 3 just yet, but expectations are that this will launch shortly after SAGE Labs goes live. 

## Sneak Peeks

To wrap up this issue, we present to you the latest work-in-progress shots shared by the team! Besides concept art for the Fimbul BYOS Butch, which can be seen further up, the team also shared the entry animation for the Calico Scud ship:

![Calico Scud - Pilot sliding entry [3D Model/Animation]](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/ec6373e3c2ea26708e0017eb5df773627cbc37260bfc6337cc1499efed778638.gif)

Furthermore, the team released another small video showing different skins on a ship. This time, they [showcased the Opal JetJet](https://youtu.be/c9JgH4LfpOg). Note that the black skin used is the BOB (black-on-black) skin that was awarded to people as part of the Rebirth campaign in 2021.

Lastly, we have a few more concept art pieces of the Fimbul BYOS Butch and the Fimbul Mamba EX:
