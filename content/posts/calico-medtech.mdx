For quick aid and recovery, the Calico Medtech comes to the rescue. Multiple flight modes allow for pinpoint accuracy in even the most hard to navigate terrain and conditions. Utilize the Medtech’s tail pod-latching system and provide direct emergency medical attention with its onboard medbay facilities. Staff a small but highly skilled rescue crew and this ship is sure to be a battlefield favorite.

### Manufactured by Calico

Calico is one of the ship manufacturers that have aligned with not only one but two of the major factions: In the case of Calico, it is a major alignment with the MUD and a minor alignment with the ONI. Their blueprints and designs are therefore a mix of civilian, stealth, and military technologies.

The ships built by Calico are known for their “brilliant designs and industrial mechanical genius.” Given the market outlook from the Galactic Asset Offerings, Calico seems to be the only manufacturer for rescue vessels. With the Guardian and the Hero, Calico also offers a wider variety of multi-role ships.

If you ever want to build a Calico ship yourself, you will need the respective blueprint. How to get one? You will need to get in a manufacturer’s good graces. To get there, you will have to prove that both your interests are aligned and/or that you’re supporting them. In in-game terms, you will need to gain loyalty (aka reputation) with them, before they judge you worthy of building ships with their logo on them (accruing loyalty won’t be possible before the SCORE v1 and CREAM v1 modules have been released).

Gaining loyalty with Calico requires completing their missions. To gain access to these missions, you will either have to be a member of the MUD or ONI faction or you will need a faction passport. These passes function a little like real-world visas, allowing you to visit another faction’s territory and trade with them. More importantly, in this case, a faction pass will allow you to accept and complete missions for the manufacturers that are aligned to that faction.

Be aware that by being part of the MUD faction you will gain loyalty quicker with the Calico manufacturer since they have their major alignment with that faction. It will take you more time as an ONI to unlock Calico blueprints.

### A fully equipped Generation 2 model

Remember that all ships bought through the GAO ([Galactic Asset Offering](https://staratlaswiki.org/wiki/GAO)), are delivered fully loaded. In later game stages, new ships will be barebone and only limited components are bespoke and fixed. So – you’re not only getting a Generation 2 model, but you’re also getting more bang for your buck!

However, the ships will still fully customizable. All the various modules can be changed/sold as needed as confirmed by Bunthius (Star Atlas CPO): “_The plan right now is that all GAO ships come with filled crew/component/module slots. You’ll be able to un-slot all these GAO filler items and sell them, and respec individually._”

### Earning potential of the Calico Medtech

If you’re wondering how much you can earn with your Calico Medtech in Star Atlas, here are some facts:

Before Star Atlas releases the full game in the Unreal 5 engine, all players have the opportunity to participate in the browser game (called SCORE) with their ship NFTs to generate revenue (learn all the details about the [Star Atlas mini game](https://aephia.com/star-atlas/what-is-the-star-atlas-mini-game-score/) in our guide).

If the player provides his ship to his faction (ONI, MUD or Ustur), he will receive ATLAS, the in-game currency of Star Atlas, in return. This amount is measured by the **VWAP** (the “volume weighted average price” at which the ship was offered in the Galactic Asset Offering) of your ships. For the Calico Medtech, the VWAP is **$942,80** USDC.

So if you have the opportunity to buy this ship at a price below the VWAP, this could be a good deal for you (of course no financial or ship advice).
