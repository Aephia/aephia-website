Overhaul your inexpensive, terrestrial antiques into formidable, spacefaring frigates with this new BYOS package by Fimbul. ‘From scrapyards, to Glory!’ If you like cannons —if you really, really like cannons— you’re in for quite a treat. The best part about building your own ship is the choice to exceed the number and size of weapon hardpoints that our team of quality BYOS engineers certified as the safe maximum. Go ahead, no one will blame you; the stock Tankship plan is armed to the hilt, but more is always better. We’ve even designed guns to put on your guns. If you want proof of firepower, fire all your forward cannons simultaneously and watch your velocity drop; do it from a standstill and you’ll accelerate backwards! Let your adversaries enjoy a heaping scoop of gunboat diplomacy and tank your way through the most delicate of situations, just like your ancient, industrial-era, Earth ancestors did.

### A fully equipped Generation 1 model

Remember that all ships bought through the GAO ([Galactic Asset Offering](https://staratlaswiki.org/wiki/GAO)), are delivered fully loaded. In later game stages, new ships will be barebone and only limited components are bespoke and fixed. So – you’re not only getting a Generation 1 model, but you’re also getting more bang for your buck!

However, the ships will still fully customizable. All the various modules can be changed/sold as needed as confirmed by Bunthius (Star Atlas CPO): “_The plan right now is that all GAO ships come with filled crew/component/module slots. You’ll be able to un-slot all these GAO filler items and sell them, and respec individually._”

### Earning potential of the Fimbul BYOS Tankship

If you’re wondering how much you can earn with your Fimbul BYOS Tankship in Star Atlas, here are some facts:

Before Star Atlas releases the full game in the Unreal 5 engine, all players have the opportunity to participate in the browser game (called SCORE) with their ship NFTs to generate revenue (learn all the details about the [Star Atlas mini game](https://aephia.com/star-atlas/what-is-the-star-atlas-mini-game-score/) in our guide).

If the player provides his ship to his faction (ONI, MUD or Ustur), he will receive ATLAS, the in-game currency of Star Atlas, in return. This amount is measured by the **VWAP** (the “volume weighted average price” at which the ship was offered in the Galactic Asset Offering) of your ships. For the Fimbul BYOS Tankship, the VWAP is **$102,118** USDC.

So if you have the opportunity to buy this ship at a price below the VWAP, this could be a good deal for you (of course no financial or ship advice).
