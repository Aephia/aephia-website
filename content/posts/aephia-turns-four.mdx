_Four years ago, on July 18th, 2021, we officially opened the doors to Aephia Industries, one of the first Star Atlas DACs. Since then, we’ve walked a long road together. Through market crashes, ecosystem shocks, delays, and uncertainty, we stood firm, building, adapting, and contributing every step of the way._

**Congratulations, Aephians!** Today marks four years of Aephia Industries! We could not have done it without you.

## Through the Highs and Lows

Four and a half years ago, the founders of Star Atlas shared their vision through a white paper and opened the Discord server. That moment sparked a wave of enthusiasm that brought many of us together, and Aephia was born shortly after. Since then, the road has not always been smooth.

We’ve collectively seen the highs of 2021 fade into the deep bear market of 2023\. We witnessed the collapse of FTX, the draining of treasuries from prominent projects, and growing skepticism around the viability of crypto gaming. Internally, the Star Atlas team faced its own struggles, trying to bring an engaging game to life under heavy constraints. At times, it felt like progress had stalled.

And yet, we remained.

Aephia Anniversary PFP 2025

Over the past few months, things seem to have started turning a corner. While the influx of new players and increased income streams (for the team) are still developing, the initial gameplay itself has begun to mature. Even in its limited state, Star Atlas is showing early signs of becoming a sustainable product, less tied to the ebb and flow of market hype, and more grounded in actual play.

At Aephia, we’ve continued to believe in the long-term potential of this universe. We’ve kept our focus on building and on doing what we do best: contributing value to the broader ecosystem and providing our members with the tools, guidance, and structure they need to thrive.

## Four Years of Building

Though the journey has tested our resolve, Aephia Industries never stood still.

Over the past year, we have continued to publish our **weekly Star Atlas newsletter** and expanded our **guides** to cover new and evolving aspects of the game.

We also scaled up our **public dashboards**, providing a growing number of data-driven insights for all community members. These dashboards are well-maintained and have long played a central role in our weekly Sunday meetings (**198 episodes and counting**). A little over half a year ago, we spun out the analytics and economic deep dives into a separate, strategy-focused session on Saturdays. Both meetings now run weekly, each with its own distinct purpose, and typically last around two hours.

On the Unreal Engine front, we’ve launched **weekly Gunplay training sessions to help members familiarize themselves with the latest mechanics and tactics,** now that the gameplay experience has become more engaging and worthwhile. Soon, this will shift into a higher gear with the addition of progression.

Behind the scenes, we’ve been actively working to set up the **Aephia DAO**. This structure will ultimately empower our members to take collective ownership and shape the direction of Aephia in a truly decentralized manner.

And as always, we’ve been building. Some tools we’ve teased, others are yet to be announced. But over the course of the next seven days, we’ll be shining a light on several of these efforts!

## COPA

Just yesterday, we submitted our pitch deck to the Star Atlas team in the hopes of being invited to the COPA ’25 finale later this month. It’s hard to believe that it’s already been well over a year since the team awarded us **first place at COPA ’24**, unanimously recognizing the work we’ve done and the path we’ve laid out.

That award was not just a win for Aephia; it was a sign that long-term thinking, community focus, and consistent output matter.

This year, we aim to demonstrate that we’ve not only lived up to the expectations we set last year, but that we’ve surpassed them.

## A Week of Celebration

In true Aephia fashion, we’re not limiting ourselves to a single day of celebration. Over the next seven days, we’ll be rolling out a series of **surprises, releases, collaborations, articles, and tools**. Some will be familiar. Others will be entirely new. All are meant to reflect the continued growth of Aephia and our commitment to advancing Star Atlas.

We’ll provide updates on our major initiatives, including **Cataclysm** and **AstralPass**, alongside some fresh launches!

Keep an eye on our channels. Each day will bring something new!

## Thank You

Finally, and most importantly, to all of our members: **Thank you**!

Thank you for being here! Thank you for staying through the quiet times, for lending your skills and energy, and for helping Aephia become the welcoming, driven community it is today.

Without you, there would be no Aephia, at least not in the form it exists now. Your dedication, feedback, creativity, and camaraderie are what make this place special. We are deeply grateful to all who’ve contributed over the past four years.

There are far too many to mention all by name, but we want to take a moment to acknowledge some of the incredible contributions made by members across all parts of our organization.

**Community Experts** — For helping with onboarding, moderating, explaining Web3, the game, and the economy to others, and for helping keep us on track: **Boen**, **Mizz**, **Moustacheride**, **Sherwood**, **Valkynen**, **West\_Co**, and **Zellax**!

**ALF** — Major thanks to **Tom** and **Dez** for managing our _AEP Life Form_ project day to day! A special shout-out to ALF’s investment team as well, for managing and growing our bags behind the scenes: **Inevitable**, **Mantabowl**, **Tykken**, and once again, **Tom**, for leading the charge here. 💪

**Cataclysm** — Huge thanks to **Valkynen** for balancing family, a demanding game dev job (crunch and all), and the development of a fun and polished card game for the Star Atlas community. Progress may have been slower than we originally hoped, but we’ve reached a point where Cataclysm is a genuinely enjoyable game to play. 😎
Also, a special thank you to **Sensei Yamura** for all his contributions on the art side of this project.

**Viktor** — For the _immense_ amount of time you’ve poured into our three Flipside dashboards, 463+ charts and tables (and many more that have been deprecated), past dashboards, tutorial videos, for hosting our weekly 2-hour **Strategy Meeting** on Saturdays, and for co-hosting our **Sunday Meeting** each week as well!

**UE5 Trainers & Organizers** — **Grob**, **Z**, and **LampChairFloor**: Thank you for stepping up and taking ownership of our weekly UE5 play/training sessions!

**Metaverse Explorer** — For covering the game for the last 4 years with his videos, helping to keep the player base up to speed, and doing it all in a jovial, humorous way.

**Brutus** — For all your design work—shirts, profile pictures, assets, and quite a few things not yet seen by the public.

**Stratugo** — For helping out wherever possible, especially on the Data Runner front, but also with tools and services. You’ve been lending your support for years already!

**222TheMaster222** — For supporting development on tools and services as well!

**Siphaawal** — For dedicating time to UE5 playtesting as part of the Vantarah crew.

**Zellax** — For providing spreadsheets, assisting in our strategy meetings, and keeping Viktor sane ;-)

**Lastly**, I would like to acknowledge my co-founder, **Prometheus**; former management member, **Sensei Yamura**; and current fellow management members, **Dez** and **Viktor**, for their day-to-day contributions, numerous brainstorming sessions, and for carrying much of the heavy lifting required to keep Aephia moving forward on its trajectory.

From all of us at Aephia:

**Happy 4th Anniversary!**
