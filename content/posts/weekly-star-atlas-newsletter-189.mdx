Star Atlas Summer

## Star Atlas Summer

Last week, the biggest news was an [announcement of an announcement](https://aephia.com/star-atlas/weekly-star-atlas-newsletter-188/). This week, as expected, we got the actual announcement.

The team is hosting **three Town Halls**, each tied to a product release, spaced out over the next month—on **July 30th**, **August 13th**, and **August 27th**.

The first, taking place during **Community Week**, was previously teased as the “Secret Event.” That mystery is now solved: it’s a Town Hall and a product launch.

What’s launching? The long-awaited **UE5 Summer patch**! A release the team had hinted might land in July, and they’ve just made it, right at the tail end. Among other highlights, this patch will introduce the fully finished Paizul Arena (see sneak peek below), persistent servers for gunplay matches, and on-chain progression!

Together with Community Week and the run of Town Halls, this full campaign is being promoted as **Star Atlas Summer**.

## Star Atlas Cinematic

Alongside the UE5 Summer patch announcement, the team revealed that a **3-minute cinematic video** will premiere on **July 30th**. This marks the **official release of Part 1** of the cinematic trilogy first shown at last year’s Impact Summit. Until now, it hadn’t been shared through any official channels.

While many community members have likely seen a version of it, this will be its first wide release.

It’s not clear when the next two parts will be published, but the team let us know that it won’t be during the Summer event. As part of the announcement, the team [teased the first minute](https://x.com/staratlas/status/1945209506658705847) of the cinematic on X as a teaser.
