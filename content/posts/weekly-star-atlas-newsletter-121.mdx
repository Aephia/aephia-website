_Welcome to our 121st newsletter on Star Atlas! This weekly newsletter, published by Aephia Industries, focuses entirely on the development of this ambitious game. Here, we try to aggregate all the newsworthy tidbits revealed \[mainly by the team\]_ _throughout the past week_.

Last week was the quietest one in a while, so this will be a short issue. The big news was that the Titan ship introduced last week, the Rainbow Phi, has already been sold! But of more importance to most of you, was the news that the team added priority fees to all transactions in SAGE Labs (and the Galactic Marketplace) in an effort to make SAGE playable again.

_Let’s jump straight in!_

Star Atlas – The first Rainbow Phi Titans ship was Sold!

## Rainbow Phi Sold

After the [official announcement](https://aephia.com/star-atlas/weekly-star-atlas-newsletter-120/) that the Pearce T1 Titan ship was sold, last Monday, the team added a brand new Titan ship to the Galactic Marketplace, the [Rainbow Phi](https://play.staratlas.com/market/phi4PYgmxeTMLLpGkU87T16VUZ6AjWZESkfT1JGJ635/)!

Within 48 hours, that ship was officially sold to an undisclosed party. Many details are currently not yet known, but unlike the sale of the Pearce T1, it was confirmed that the Rainbow Phi was bought by an individual instead of by a collective.

Star Atlas – GDC 2024 Announcement

## Game Developers Conference ’24

Some members of the Star Atlas team will be attending the Game Developers Conference in San Fransisco this week, alongside their partners, MetaGravity. Presence has been confirmed for _Michael_ (CEO), _Chris_ (Head of Game Economy), and _Dominic Vain_ (Community Manager).

Note that the Star Atlas team is not giving an official presentation at GDC. Instead, the trio mentioned above will be at (or near) MetaGravity’s official booth (S927), where they will discuss Star Atlas and their partnership with MetaGravity.

MetaGravity has invited several of their partners to join their booth, where they will showcase their HyperScale Engine (the official name for their massive multiplayer tech) and (obviously) their partnerships. The MetaGravity team is not lined up for an official presentation during the conference either.

## Solana Struggles Continue

In the past week, the team has deployed several improvements to SAGE Labs and the Galactic Marketplace. Most notably, they added priority fees to all transactions. However, transactions will still fail occasionally as the whole Solana network is struggling. This will likely continue for at least a few more weeks.

Solana v1.18, the next upgrade of the validator software (the core of Solana), is expected to bring some solace with its upgraded Scheduler. However, this update will not go live before mid-April.

Decrypt wrote an [article](https://decrypt.co/221448/solana-weighs-significant-changes-network-demand) that provides more background as to what is going on. [Helius’ article](https://www.helius.dev/blog/solana-fees-in-theory-and-practice) on Solana fees is also worth a read if you are more technically inclined.

Sammy (Software engineer @ ATMTA) had the following to say from Star Atlas’ side of things:

> Right now, I don’t think there’s much we can do on our end. Priority fees are sorta broken right now, and in theory, an update coming mid-April should (hopefully) fix that and make the priority fee markets less busted. In the meantime, there may be a few things we can do at the RPC level. Solana is the issue right now, and nothing on our side will really help that very much.
> 
> With the Solana price just skyrocketing along with usage, we’re really testing Solana at its core. Hopefully, all the issues this increased usage brings will be resolved ASAP, but none of the solutions are really something that can be deployed without weeks or months of testing.

Perhaps also noteworthy, for those more technically inclined, are these two messages by Mert (Co-founder Helius) and Jacob (Head of Developer Relations at the Solana Foundation):

ok seeing a lot of confusion on solana txns and fees still

if your txns aren&#39;t confirming, there are a few reasons for this:

i) you didn&#39;t add fees

ii) even if you did add fees, the current solana client is buggy and **a higher fee might not guarantee that your transaction…

There&#39;s a coordinated effort to figure out how to fix this on many fronts

&#8211; Scheduler in 1.18(still needs testing before adoption)
&#8211; Getting guidance to rpc/validators on how to use swqos
&#8211; figure out how to do something similar to swqos on Jito
&#8211; understand quic connection…

_And that is a wrap! Short and sweet. Until next week!_
