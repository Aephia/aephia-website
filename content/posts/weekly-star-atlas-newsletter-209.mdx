_Welcome to our 209th newsletter on Star Atlas! This weekly newsletter, published by Aephia Industries, focuses entirely on the development of this ambitious game. Here, we attempt to aggregate all the newsworthy tidbits revealed, primarily by the team, throughout the past week._

The team had been urging the community to tune in to last week’s Economic Forum, promising it would be a big one — and they weren’t exaggerating! The proposed economic overhaul outlined by Chris (VP of Game Economy) has the potential to fundamentally reshape ship sales, token emissions, and the Galactic Market, marking one of the most significant shifts in Star Atlas’ economic direction to date. Beyond that headline topic, this week also brings updates on Never Alone rewards, new tooling in the SAGE Editor Suite, the DAO Council election nearing its close, and another Iris’ Blessing raffle.

_Let’s dive right in!_

## Economic Overhaul

During [last week’s 19th Economic Forum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMnuFdop94E), Chris presented a proposal that could drastically change how the team will handle token sales, ship sales, and the Galactic Market as a whole. Plus, they would add additional redeemable ship recipes to the game.

Below are the relevant slides from the presentation (slides 3-8). However, it’s definitely best to check out the full [recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMnuFdop94E) when you have a moment!

Star Atlas – 19th Economic Forum – A Positive Feedback Loop (Slide 8)

In short, the team proposes to:

* Lower the prices of the ships the team is selling, to right above market price levels
* Sell their ships in exchange for USDC only
* Reduce marketplace fees to 0% (for a 60-day period)
* Reduce their token sales by 1 dollar for every 1 dollar earned through ship sales.
* Buy back ships in ATLAS by siphoning a stream of ATLAS from token emissions.
* Buy ATLAS from DEXes once income from ship sales exceeds their current token sales income by an undisclosed margin.
* Add new ship redemption recipes in-game, while simultaneously adding buy-orders in ATLAS for those ships (using the ATLAS emissions, as mentioned above).

There is more to it than this, of course, and the above slides already give a good impression of the subtleties that would come into play as well. It’s best to check [the recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMnuFdop94E) yourself to become familiar with all the ins and outs of this setup.

Those present during the presentation and Q&A overwhelmingly supported the proposal, and as a result, these changes will likely be implemented later this month!

## Never Alone Rewards

Last week, we wrote about the Never Alone rewards becoming available through the metacrafting mechanic in SAGE, and the team has now added all the prizes. For the full story, see [last week’s issue](https://aephia.com/star-atlas/weekly-star-atlas-newsletter-208/). Below, we are once more listing the reward (packages), for your convenience:

**Mission 1:**

* Memory Glimpse: Exclusive Character Skin,
* Memory Fragment: VZUS Solos,
* Memory Revelation: Exclusive VZUS Solos Ship Skin

![Star Atlas - Never Alone - Mission 2 Rewards [old promo image from when the mission was launched]](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/d7bf0d74aa840d21a87aa3df07a216bb139b62d4d54c59ab3864c6927655eaa0.png)

Star Atlas – Never Alone – Mission 2 Rewards \[old promo image from when the mission was launched\]

**Mission 2:**

* Memory Glimpse: Exclusive Never Alone Emote
* Memory Fragment: Fimbul ECOS Unibomba
* Memory Revelation: Exclusive CORE Century Cover

**Mission 3:**

* Memory Glimpse: Prayer to Iris
* Memory Fragment: Fimbul Airbike
* Memory Revelation: Puri Pet

**All three Memory Glimpses:**

* Unibomba
* Ship Component Upgrade Bundle
* Glimpse of a Forgotten Life Title

**All three Memory Fragments:**

* Calico Maxhog
* Ship Component Upgrade
* Foundation Room Access
* Fragments of a Forgotten Life Title

**All three Memory Revelations:**

* Ogrika Niruch
* Ship Components Upgrade Bundle
* Saand Crewmember
* Foundation Room Access
* Revelations of a Forgotten Life Title

If you participated throughout the campaign, you would at most have earned one memory glimpse, fragment, and revelation for each of the three missions. 
**Important**: This means you would have to choose between a reward package using 3 of those rewards from across all three missions for a bigger reward package, or using them one by one for a specific reward. You can mix and match, of course, but you can only spend each memory once. Unless you acquire more on the marketplace, that is.

## SES – 3D Galaxy Viewer

During [last week’s Atlas Brew](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgW93o0rfRk), Danny (CPO) joined to demonstrate the latest addition to the SAGE Editor Suite, the [3D Galaxy Viewer](https://ses.staratlas.com/3D%20Galaxy%20Viewer/index.html). 

![SES - 3D Galaxy Viewer](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/971c4678181ead644a3d7a46cbc48b3826562cada424f657467ca704f551e073.png)

SES – 3D Galaxy Viewer

This Viewer allows you to explore the C4 Galia Expanse in 3 dimensions and even spawn a ship to fly through it. Danny shared that he vibe-coded this in about a week, and though it looks pretty cool, it hasn’t been optimized much. It will also not be featured in the new C4 game interface. It’s solely meant as a great-looking map explorer.

If you haven’t already, definitely [check it out](https://ses.staratlas.com/3D%20Galaxy%20Viewer/index.html)! Take note, however, it may take a bit to load because it’s pretty resource-intensive.

Aephia – [STV Visualizer](https://stv.aephia.com/) – Council 3rd Term Elections

## DAO Council Elections

The elections for the 3rd DAO Council term are in full swing! Voting is about to close at the end of this Wednesday (UTC), **December 10th**.

At the time of publication, a little over 100 million Polis Voting Power (PVP) has been cast already, and Atlas\_freeks is set _not_ to make it on the Council. That said, the Council elections tend to be in flux up until the last minute, so a lot can still happen!

Go ahead and [vote](https://govern.staratlas.com/proposals/91cc73fa-0af7-41ea-86c5-bab7ffcfcb4f) if you haven’t already!

![Iris' Blessing - December](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/d694df365342db1498ddfc2dc49bfa6e63335ccb7cd21382ecd3e80fa3af70d3.png)

Iris’ Blessing – December

## Iris’ Blessing Raffle

This Friday, December 12th, during the first Galia Game Night, the community team will raffle the second batch of prizes among those who have collected raffle tickets on Discord!

## News Bit

Here is a last, small bit of news for this week:

The team is looking to gather a group of econ-savvy individuals from the community to step up and take a seat in the economic variant of the Vantarah group (testing UE5) to help Chris in the Econ department. There may be a form coming online soon that allows economic enthusiasts to toss their hat into the ring, but this is not entirely clear.

## Sneak Peeks

It looks like [João Lira](https://www.artstation.com/lirart) wasn’t done publishing his artwork for the different races (which we shared in our [previous issue](https://aephia.com/star-atlas/weekly-star-atlas-newsletter-208/)). This past week, he added a truckload more. So many more, in fact, that we’ll only show a few hand-picked images, and instead link to all the various ArtStation projects he added:
