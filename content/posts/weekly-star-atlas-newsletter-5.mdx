## News

Star Atlas just released [a public roadmap hosted on Notion](https://staratlas.notion.site/staratlas/72cb710bbd894cd8819bde948e42ac31?v=5c5cca97579e4cd79089362bf03e55b1). This roadmap aims to provide a sequence of game components that will be released. Please keep in mind that all the information in this public roadmap will adhere to the team’s terminologies: TARGET and CONFIRMED as indicated. Make sure to bookmark this page to keep track of any changes as well as new game components.

## Gameplay

Shipbuilding is one of the few professions that is possible in the metaverse. The team mentioned that the time it takes to manufacture a ship will differ depending on the size of the ship. Megaprojects will likely take quite a long time by default, but can potentially be sped up through additional contributions. All resources will be required, though the team might decide to break it out so that segments of a ship can be built and combined over time. For capital ships, it may even take weeks or even months.They will assess material capacity across the universe, feed that into the crafting formulas, and determine how much NFT inflation is appropriate. These are all naturally variable based on user growth.

On the topic of earning, the team stated that there will be many activities that allow for income generation in ATLAS. The timing surrounding the release of all of those features is uncertain until most features are complete. Emission rates are the upper bound in the short term and perform as a balancing act to determine precisely how much ATLAS should be distributed. They also have target income rates denominated in ATLAS, but calculated against a USD exchange rate.

## Assets

For lands, tier 5 claim stakes cover a larger and deeper area of operation. This makes room for additional structures, greater productivity, and the ability to mine rarer materials. Additional information will be released towards the launch of land sales. 

Two new ships will be announced on November 2 then will be made available after two days through the [GAO](https://staratlas.com/gao-brochure.pdf).

## Development

The team wants to be relatively conservative/restrictive of external development contributions directly to the Star Atlas metaverse at this stage. While they fully support ancillary services and experiences being built that incorporate Star Atlas assets, it's unlikely those experiences would be seamlessly integrated into the metaverse for a number of years. They do not restrict that type of development, though the economic design of the team building the feature would be reliant on them to define. They are currently spending time with integrations across DeFi primitives. Things like the DAO framework and lending protocols are being coordinated with external teams, and those functions will function seamlessly within the game. To perhaps simplify, any GUI derived experience will be limited in the near and medium terms, unless we receive a compelling proposal from said team.
