Last week was a big week for _SAGE Labs: Starbased_, as two long-awaited changes were finally rolled out! On top of that, less expected, the team rolled out their new _Meta Crafting Station_, enabling players to craft items from outside of the official Star Atlas universe. But that is not all; the team also announced the date for the next Town Hall, which is a little further away than we thought: Wednesday, July 3rd.

_But let’s not get ahead of ourselves! Let’s dive in!_

## Starbased Update

The team rolled out several updates to Starbased on June 20th, and below, we’ll go over them one by one!

### SDU Component Cost Update

Last week finally saw the rollout of the much-anticipated SDU Component Cost update. From now on, upgrading Starbases to the next Tier will be much cheaper (SDU-wise). We published the new numbers in our [previous issue](https://aephia.com/star-atlas/weekly-star-atlas-newsletter-134/), and you can, of course, also find these updated in our [Starbased Guide](https://aephia.com/star-atlas/starbased-the-missing-manual/).

On the topic of scanning, one additional balancing change the team made was lowering the Scan Sector Cooldown from 10 minutes to 9 minutes.

### Automatic LP Contribution

To quote the team: “In an effort to make ATLAS earnings easier to understand and make the game more resilient to manipulation, which negatively impacts certain player demographics, LP will now automatically be deposited towards the epoch’s LP pool upon receiving it.” Players will no longer receive LP to deposit at a time of their choosing. 

This is a deviation from the original plans, where LP would still find its way to players, even though it would also be registered for the daily ATLAS payout. But there would have been two issues with this, which the team simply solved by not handing out LP at all:

* LP can not be spent – there is no LP store yet, so LP would just accumulate without having an actual use case
* it would introduce a double-spend problem over the next two weeks

#### LP Deposit Deprecation

On this last note, the team will allow everyone to deposit their saved-up Loyalty Points to acquire part of the daily ATLAS emissions over a **two-week period** that started June 20th (when these changes were released). After that, the LP deposit feature will be deactivated.

### LP Reward Update

Alongside the SDU changes, the team also tweaked the Loyalty Point rewards for each component contribution as well. The more advanced materials have seen major reductions in LP rewards, especially. Below, we’ve posted a table showing the new and old LP rewards for each component:

| **Component**         | **New LP** | **Old LP** |
| --------------------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| Toolkits              | **14**     | 6          |
| Food                  | **6**      | 3          |
| Frameworks            | **48**     | 48         |
| Electronics           | **76**     | 70         |
| Power Sources         | **108**    | 90         |
| Electromagnets        | **135**    | 128        |
| Field Stabilizers     | **255**    | 288        |
| Radiation Absorbers   | **325**    | 768        |
| Particle Accelerators | **480**    | 1920       |
| SDUs                  | **1100**   | 1100       |

Starbased – The new Meta Crafting Station

### Meta Crafting Station

The team added a brand-new Meta Crafting Station to SAGE Labs! This allows players to craft items from outside the Star Atlas ecosystem. Though we were expecting this to be added at some point, its release just this past week came unannounced and unexpected.

The very first recipe added is one for a limited edition poster created by the _SuperphoenixDAO_, dubbed _The Edge of Paradise_.

Honeyland seems to be next in line to get a Meta Crafting recipe added, with [an event](https://www.youtube.com/live/PGv1EfDPr6E?feature=shared) scheduled for later today (21:00 UTC) on June 24th. Both Corey (CEO of Hexagon Studios) and Michael (CEO of ATMTA) will be revealing more information about this collaboration. Originally, this collaboration was supposed to go live at the beginning of the year, but in the end, that did not come to fruition due to planning issues on ATMTA’s side.

## Starbased – Feature Freeze

With this latest update, the team announced a _temporary pausing_ of the regular updates to _Starbased_. This means that the team won’t make any mechanical (gameplay) changes going forward. Numbers are a different story, so Chris would still be able to rebalance some numbers if he wanted to.

The reason for this is that the team wants to focus on getting Fleet Command out first. In order to do that, they need to reach feature parity between the two different SAGE products. Complicating this is the reality that it is harder to implement UI changes into the 3D experience of Fleet Command than it is to do so in the SAGE Labs interface.

In other words, any change they make to Starbased requires them to put even more time into Fleet Command. If they would keep doing that, they will never be able to get to the point where the two products offer the exact same feature set.

Note that this freeze will _not affect_ the rollout of the Crew packs and Crew-based functionality in Starbased. Crew will still come online before Fleet Command, as planned.

## Town Hall – July 3rd

The next Town Hall will be held on July 3rd, one hour after the brew ends, at 19:00 UTC. 

According to the announcement, we will get the latest on:

* Crew Packs
* UE5 development
* Roadmap updates
* _REDACTED_
* _REDACTED_
* and A LOT MORE.

According to Dominic (Community Manager), this will be the greatest Town Hall ever, with almost every expected near-future update being touched upon. We’ll have to wait a little longer to find out if he was right.

## Community Meetup – Las Vegas

From August 15-17, the team will attend the Rare Evo event in Las Vegas. They intend to host a community meetup there and would like to gauge the number of community members who would want to attend. To that end, there is a [Luma link](https://lu.ma/0vr4juuv) for the event where people can sign up. _The exact time and place are not yet known_, however.

There is also a new _#vegas-2024_ channel on the Star Atlas Discord server where you can stay up to date and/or help brainstorm.

_That was it for this week! Thanks for reading!_
