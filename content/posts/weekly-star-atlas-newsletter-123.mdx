Last week was relatively quiet, but we did get some good stuff from the team. The first UE5 Surge test took place, and the Quarterly Econ Paper for Q1 of 2024 was released. The big news, however, was the announcement that Starbased will go live this Tuesday, April 2nd. There was also some bad news: the team closed down the over-the-counter (OTC) trading channel on the official Discord server after a scam.

_Without further ado, let’s dive in!_

![SAGE - Starbased](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/523aa0321fe197fb17e7215c8b3b3e12a0d648c9460978acab793813fc8edbf7.jpg)

## SAGE: Starbased

SAGE: Starbased will go live on Tuesday, April 2nd! Like with previous launches, expect this to happen near the end of the (US) day. It’s likely the team will launch after 12 AM **_UTC_** (so, on April 3rd UTC) to ensure players have a (more or less) full epoch (24 hours) to get their ships and goods in!

Starbased is not yet live by the time we send out this newsletter. However, when it has been released, you can jump into it using the new ULR: [based.staratlas.com](https://based.staratlas.com).

### Two-week Transition Period

While Starbased will go live, the team ensured that the current iterations of SAGE Labs (V1, V2, 3D) will remain fully operational and its ATLAS earnings (through Council RFR) intact **until April 16th.**

After that date, the earnings will go to 0\. However, you will still be able to extract your assets from the game.

Looking at Faction Fleet, earnings there will continue until April 16th as well. However, _these will be slashed by 50%_ (another 33% compared with where they started)!

There is one thing that won’t be eased in: **Mining ships will stop producing R4 in Faction Claims on April 2nd!**

### SDUs Before April 16th

On April 2nd, when Starbased goes live, the SDU mechanic will temporarily mimic the one we currently have in SAGE Labs. This means that there will be a cap of 2000 SDUs that can be found per minute in Starbased until April 16th.

Interestingly, the 2000/minute cap on SDUs will remain in the current version of SAGE Labs. This means that, in theory, players could find up to 4000 SDUs per minute spread over both games.

After April 16th, no more SDUs will spawn in the old version of SAGE Labs! Meanwhile, in Starbased, the SDU mechanic is about to radically change!

### SDUs After April 16th

After April 16th, the SDU mechanics will change drastically in Starbased! First off, there is no more cap, meaning players will be able to find well over 2000 SDUs per minute in-game.

Second, the scanning mechanic itself will completely change! The team has not shared any details yet, but we know that the tile SDU regeneration & discovery will be changed. 

In addition, every ship will get a new stat: **SDUs Per Scan**. This new ship stat works much like mining now: Each ship will simply gather a number of SDUs per scan. Similar to the mining rates for each ship, the SDUs/scan ratio will scale with ship class. You can get an idea of what this looks like by checking out Chip’s Ship Spec spreadsheet.

Another big change is that this new scanning mechanic will rely on **_Food_** instead of **_Toolkits_** to scan. It’s not yet clear if Datarunner ships will also require Food, but they do get a significant bonus to their SDU discovery rate!

Other interesting tidbits:

* You will still need to scan repeatedly.
* Cooldowns will take longer. However, the SDUs found per scan will be higher on average to help keep Solana transaction fee costs in check.
* A ship’s scanning rate will depend on the class & tier of its Scanner and the scan spec bonus of the ship.
* SDUs serve no other purpose than to upgrade Starbases, but are planned for other things in the future!

### Related Reading

We published two articles last week that relate to Starbased. The first is a [Career Guide](https://aephia.com/star-atlas/star-atlas-career-guide/), which is primarily based on the Roadmap that came out two weeks ago, but it may be of interest now that Licenses come online alongside Starbased.

The second, [A New Economic Paradigm](https://aephia.com/star-atlas/a-new-economic-paradigm/), is really an overview of the ATLAS Emissions so far and the radical changes coming with Starbased. It compares the team’s emission strategy with Faction Fleet, Council RFRs, and now Starbased. It covers various aspects of the Loyalty Point/ATLAS system and ends by looking at planned emissions (2021) and actual emissions up until now.

## Quarterly Economic Report

With the first quarter of 2024 almost over, the team published their [Quarterly Economic Report for Q1 of 2024](https://staratlas.com/newsroom/economic-reports/star-atlas-economic-report-2024-q1).

Its key highlights were:

* Council RFRs accounted for 50% of ATLAS emissions throughout the quarter on average
* The remaining SCORE participants re-invest ATLAS earnings into resources, ships, and structures.
* Aggregate census wealth increased by 53.85%, and residents and citizens saw the largest jump in wealth share.
* Daily Star Atlas GDP averaged approximately $88,000 throughout the quarter. Projecting $32,120,000 annual GDP.
* SAGE crafting output increased by over 200% due to a large increase in the SAGE labor force, likely driven by the introduction of council RFRs.
* Wealth across the top five DACs accounts for approximately 7.3% of aggregate Star Atlas ecosystem wealth.

Star Atlas – Surge Test #1

## Surge Test

This past Saturday, 18:00 UTC, the [planned](https://aephia.com/star-atlas/weekly-star-atlas-newsletter-122/) UE5 Surge test went live for a few hours. It started with some hiccups as an emergency patch was required (launched a few minutes after the test should have started), faction scoring was not working, and there was a lot of lag.

However, over 150 players showed up and had a fun time together. The team gained valuable insights into what caused the lag and will work on fixing that over the coming week. It was nice to see such a large group of team members (including the 3 co-founders) show up as well.

The plan is to host (at least two) more of these sessions until most issues are solved and the team can launch its official public stress test, in which testers will be rewarded with sweet assets for participating!

Stay tuned for more!

Star Atlas – Surge Test #1

## OTC Channel closed

In an unexpected move, the team closed down the dedicated buy-sell-trade (over-the-counter) channel in the official Star Atlas Discord. This was Michael’s call, in response to a support ticket of someone who got scammed in that very channel. Michael shared that he was unaware that the channel even existed, but that having it meant that the team also had a certain responsibility regarding things going wrong there.

Michael’s exact words:

> When people get scammed in our _official_ discord in an _official_ channel we have established, it implies some level of liability or responsibility on us to take an action to resolve that situation. There are a number of deeper philosophical questions under consideration here, including utilizing something like freeze authority. This was all recently brought to my attention through a support request from the team. I don’t think I’ve personally ever posted within this channel. While I’m not opposed to people trading OTC, I am opposed to adding more risk to our company.
