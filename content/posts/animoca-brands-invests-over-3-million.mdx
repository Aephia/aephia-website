_“We are looking forward to using these hyper-realistic spaceships in the Star Atlas metaverse when it launches, and to capitalize on its promising in-game economy while we drive opportunities for collaboration and synergy with our products, partners, and the other companies in our investment portfolio.”_

Pablo Quiroga, co-founder and CRO of Star Atlas, added: _“Inspiring collaborations are valuable when the community at large benefits from early visionary supporters like Animoca Brands.
