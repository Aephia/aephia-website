The second UE5 Multiplayer Stress test is coming, and everyone participating will be rewarded! But there is a lot more about to happen in the Star Atlas ecosystem! This Tuesday, April 16th, expect some impactful changes to the Economy and Starbased!

This is all in the (near) future, however. What happened last week? Well, the Fimbul ECOS Superphoenix Titan was officially sold. On top of that, the Surge gameplay mode, which will take the spotlight during the aforementioned stress test, has been opened up for everyone to practice!

_Let’s dive in!_

## Economy Changes

This week will see a number of big events taking place, specifically on Tuesday, April 16th:

1. Faction Fleet ATLAS Emissions will be turned off
2. The “old” SAGE Labs game will be sunset
3. Starbased changes – Discussed further down below

### Faction Fleet Sunset

After well over 2.5 years of operations, the ATLAS emissions for _Faction Fleet_ (aka SCORE) will come to an end this Tuesday. This means that ships won’t earn any ATLAS anymore by being staked in the program, nor should any of the R4 supplied be subtracted.

Note that _Faction Claims_ will continue to run until the team has a viable alternative for _Claims Stakes_. Earlier, shortly after the release of Starbased, the team did stop the R4 emissions for staked mining ships. This means that from Tuesday onward only Claim Stakes will still be able to earn (R4) emissions. Ships will have to be used actively in Starbased to earn their keep.

### “Old” SAGE Labs Sunset

Due to the Solana congestion issues, the team decided to keep the old SAGE Labs running a little longer so people would have more time to transfer their assets to the new game. This has resulted in some people playing both games side-by-side in an effort to increase their earnings. This Tuesday, this will come to an end.

The team suggested that any crafting jobs started prior to April 16th will be honored, meaning these will result in the crafted items. Note that this was not officially confirmed by the team just yet, so this could still change.

Mining and SDU scanning will not result in any assets anymore, nor will it be possible to redeem materials for certain assets, such as the Council RFRs. All redemption recipes will be removed.

In short, there is really nothing left to do but extract your fleets from the game and insert them into Starbased.

### ATLAS Emissions Impact

Running Faction Fleet, SAGE Labs, and Starbased side-by-side led to a few days of very high ATLAS emissions, as Steven Sabol (former Econ team member) analyzed.

## Starbased

Now that Starbased has been live for well over a week, the team will roll out a few changes to its economic model, specifically to the Upkeep process and the way ATLAS is being emitted to those who seek to exchange their LP. 

### Upkeep Changes

The team will reduce the Starbase _upkeep_ requirements. Players are struggling with this at present as the LP reward itself for depositing _Food_ & _Toolkits_ is not enough to make it worthwhile. You will also have to _craft_ at the Starbase or help _upgrade_ the Starbases to make this financially feasible. Exact details have not been made available, but expect the _burn rate_ of Food and Toolkits to be reduced. From the phrasing, it can not be concluded that the actual LP rewards themselves will go up.

### ATLAS Emissions

The team will change the ATLAS emissions for Starbased. Instead of distributing a flat 1.5 million ATLAS to each Faction every epoch, the team will split this into four Tiers. Every epoch, each Faction is encouraged to strive to unlock the highest tier possible, as that would result in unlocking the full emission pool for their faction. If they do not succeed, the size of their emission pool will be smaller for that epoch.

Tiers are being unlocked based on the amount of LP contributed (sold) for ATLAS during that epoch. This suggests that less active Factions will see their earnings diminished. This means that the Faction Balancing mechanic is weakened, but not completely removed. If enough people join the weaker faction, become active, and supply their share of the LP, then a higher emission tier could be reached, increasing earnings for the whole faction.

The exact structure of the Tiers and LP thresholds have not yet been publicly made available.

### SDU Changes

As announced [two weeks ago](https://aephia.com/star-atlas/weekly-star-atlas-newsletter-123/), the SDU scanning mechanic will be completely overhauled on the 16th. Beyond removing the ceiling of 2000 SDUs/minute (that can be found), the way SDUs spawn and are discovered will change completely.

Every ship will get a new stat: **SDUs Per Scan**. This new ship stat works in a similar way as the _resources per second_ used for mining. Like these mining rates, the SDUs/scan ratio will scale up similarly with ship _class_. You can get an idea of what this looks like by checking out [Chip’s Ship Spec spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cfzW3uiqkbnfJexBysh0MAzZYRhiRwQg8WlsFWfuKgs/edit#gid=205337066).

A ship’s _scanning rate_ will depend on the class & tier of its _scanner_ and the scan _spec bonus_ of the ship. Data Runners, naturally, excel in scanning and will receive a nice bonus.

This new scanning rate, in combination with the new SDU “spawning” mechanic, will determine the actual number of SDUs found in a location.

Another difference with Mining is that each scan still requires a user interaction, just as it does now. However, as the cooldown after a scan has increased, there will be more downtime between subsequent interactions. To offset this, the number of SDUs found per scan (on average) will be higher. This should help keep Solana transaction costs in check.

With this new scanning rate mechanic, the cap of 10 SDUs per scan has been removed. It’s not clear yet, but it would seem reasonable that the SDU Per Scan rates for all ships in a fleet are simply added up in the same way the mining rate per ship is taken into account for a fleet.

_Note:_ For now, SDUs serve no other purpose than to upgrade Starbases. However, they will be a part of other recipes in the future!

_More details will be shared with the release tomorrow!_

## April 20 – Multiplayer “Surge” Stresstest

As we [wrote last week](https://aephia.com/star-atlas/weekly-star-atlas-newsletter-124/), the long-awaited, second multiplayer stress test in the UE5 Showroom will take place this coming Saturday, April 20th. The team hopes that they get over 1000 players online at the same time. there will be in excess of 1000 players participating. and to that end, they created two different 3-hour long slots to accommodate people from all over the globe:

1. **April 20: 18:00 UTC – 21:00 UTC**
2. **April 21: 03:00 UTC – 06:00 UTC**

To allow people some practice, **[Surge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuvL4tP57Q4) is now open** and accessible for everyone until _April 19th, 04:00 UTC_!

### Rewards

There will be on-chain rewards for all test participants! The team [announced](https://twitter.com/staratlas/status/1778534081569128867) some details surrounding the reward structure on [X](https://twitter.com/staratlas/status/1778534081569128867) last week. The first thing of note is that the originally communicated goal of getting up to 2000 concurrent users (CCU) is no more. The plan was to only give out the rarest rewards when over 1800 CCU would have been reached, but this has now been reduced to 1000.

What does **Con_c_urrent Users** (CCU) mean? It’s the number of players who are online in the game at a single point in time. Naturally, this changes over time as new players join and others exit the game. The team will measure the CCU throughout the test, and the **_maximum CCU_** reached will be used to determine the rewards.

There are 4 tiers of rewards, and which tier is reached is determined by the max CCU during the playtest:

* **Tier 1**: &lt; 300 CCU
* **Tier 2**: 300 CCU
* **Tier 3**: 500 CCU
* **Tier 4**: 1,000+ CCU

The rewards for each tier are as follows:

* **Tier 1**: ATLAS rewards
* **Tier 2**: ATLAS + 1 Common Crew
* **Tier 3**: ATLAS + 1 Uncommon Crew
* **Tier 4**: ATLAS + 1 Rare Crew

Rewards for players will scale off of concurrent users during the test:

🔹 &lt; 300 CCU: ATLAS rewards
🔹 300 CCU: ATLAS + 1 Common Crew
🔹 500 CCU: ATLAS + 1 Uncommon Crew
🔹 1,000+ CCU: ATLAS + 1 Rare Crew [pic.twitter.com/fmCx7NmZBB](https://t.co/fmCx7NmZBB)
</XTweet>
 

### Crew Card

Beyond an undisclosed amount of ATLAS (likely to scale up with each subsequent tier), Tier2+ will also reward **_all active participants_** with a Crew Card! This crew card will represent a crew member from one of the three factions. Every participant in the test will get the _exact same_ Crew Card! That crew’s faction will be the faction that wins the most Surge games **before** the server has hit 1000 CCU.

Once more: There is only one Crew Card being handed out to participants of the Stress test. The _faction of the card_ is determined through Surge gameplay, by counting the number of Faction victories. The _rarity_, on the other hand, will depend on the maximum CCU hit during the two 3-hour slots during which the test takes place.

Note that as soon as 1000 CCU has been breached, the team will stop counting the wins. This could obviously happen during the first slot already, in which case victories during the second slot would not matter. However, to get the reward, you will still have to participate of course!

## Superphoenix Titan Sold

Another Titan ship was officially _sold_ this past week! A newly formed [Superphoenix DAO](https://superphoenixdao.com/landing), under the leadership of community member _Njord_, has announced that it has entered into a purchase agreement with ATMTA to acquire the Fimbul ECOS Superphoenix.

The Superphoenix team seeks to make the Superphoenix a Titan for the Star Atlas community. To that end, they are organizing themselves as a DAO and seek to raise funds through, among other things, an NFT sale.

The goal is to [sell (up to) 10.3K NFTs](https://shdw-drive.genesysgo.net/BamXrN29Jkq9HA3UyLZWEaikDa3zcVgnP6nakvrZdQ72/whitepaper-v2.pdf) for a price of 1.5 SOL each.

This approach resembles the purchase [arrangement by the GG Collective](https://aephia.com/star-atlas/weekly-star-atlas-newsletter-120/), which tries to raise funds through a newly formed community. Similarly, if this initiative raises insufficient funds, it has a backup solution that allows it to still acquire the Titan.

Star Atlas – New Topper (3rd party) option to purchase ATLAS with Fiat

## New ATLAS On-ramp

The team has integrated Uphold’s _Topper_ on-ramp service into their [Play-portal](https://play.staratlas.com/). Clicking the Wallet icon in the menu to the left will show a new option under the _Manage Your Wallet’s Funds_ section: Topper.

Using Topper, you can directly purchase ATLAS using a wide variety of Fiat currencies.

## News Bits

* Michael [recorded a walkthrough](https://youtu.be/j55vrZNwqEQ?si=CbOPFDRpmWeqa1y_) of Star Atlas, going into both their Unreal Engine 5 offering and SAGE. It’s a slightly edited variant of the video he made for the _Crypto & Coins_ event hosted by Coins.ph in Manila.
* About that Coins.PH event: The team created a [special VZUS solos skin](https://youtu.be/W-hLMf4zbN0) for 50 of their attendees.
* Solana teams are still working hard to fix the ongoing congestion problems. Today (time of publication), a new patch (v1.17.31) has been brought to mainnet to alleviate some of these issues. However, the rollout to Solana _mainnet_ of the big v1.18 patch has been postponed by two weeks, likely to allow more time to test some [brand-new fixes](https://www.theblock.co/post/287942/anza-releases-proposed-congestion-fixes-on-solana-devnet-asks-validators-to-upgrade-on-testnet) deployed to devnet on April 12th.
