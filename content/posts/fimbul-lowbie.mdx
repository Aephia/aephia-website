Ride in pure classical comfort in this flexible flying vehicle platform. The Fimbul Lowbie is a clear sign that the driver is coming up in the world and their ambitions are finally being rewarded with a well-rounded and reliable space capable vessel. Take a slice of home with you whenever you go cruising, hauling or transporting.

[Find the Fimbul Lowbie on the Start Atlas Marketplace.](https://play.staratlas.com/market/8nqjw5UVN65GyfdqiXnfJNbDVBgbk8RpFFd7uACXenbx)

### A fully equipped Generation 2 model

Remember that all ships bought through the GAO ([Galactic Asset Offering](https://staratlaswiki.org/wiki/GAO)), are delivered fully loaded. In later game stages, new ships will be barebone and only limited components are bespoke and fixed. So – you’re not only getting a Generation 2 model, but you’re also getting more bang for your buck!

However, the ships will still fully customizable. All the various modules can be changed/sold as needed as confirmed by Bunthius (Star Atlas CPO): “_The plan right now is that all GAO ships come with filled crew/component/module slots. You’ll be able to un-slot all these GAO filler items and sell them, and respec individually._”

### Earning potential of the Fimbul Lowbie

If you’re wondering how much you can earn with your Fimbul Lowbie in Star Atlas, here are some facts:

Before Star Atlas releases the full game in the Unreal 5 engine, all players have the opportunity to participate in the browser game (called SCORE) with their ship NFTs to generate revenue (learn all the details about the [Star Atlas mini game](https://aephia.com/star-atlas/what-is-the-star-atlas-mini-game-score/) in our guide).

If the player provides his ship to his faction (ONI, MUD or Ustur), he will receive ATLAS, the in-game currency of Star Atlas, in return. This amount is measured by the **VWAP** (the “volume weighted average price” at which the ship was offered in the Galactic Asset Offering) of your ships. For the Fimbul Lowbie, the VWAP is **$60** USDC.

So if you have the opportunity to buy this ship at a price below the VWAP, this could be a good deal for you (of course no financial or ship advice).
