VWAP is here! As the start of the mini game (called SCORE) draws nearer, there is a lot of speculation about the potential earnings. Michael Wagner, CEO of Star Atlas, confirmed, that the return on investment of your space ships per year will be based on the VWAP – the “volume-weighted average price”.

Since all ships in the Galactic Asset Offering were sold in different tranches for different prices, the VWAP will be based on those waves per ship. Here is an example:

The **first wave** of the Fimbul ECOS Greenader had a supply of 450 ships that were offered for $8,200 USDC. The **second wave** had a supply of 300 ships that were offered for $9,185 USDC. This would leave us with this formula to calculate the VWAP: (450 x 8,200)+(300 x 9,185)/750\. So, our VWAP for the Greenader is $8,594 USDC.

Based on this number, you will earn ATLAS by deploying your ships in the upcoming mini game. But does it matter for the VWAP if all ships were sold? Because for the Greenader there are still ships left on the [marketplace](https://play.staratlas.com/market) from the first wave and the second wave hasn’t even been touched. Wagner confirmed that this wouldn’t matter: “It is based on total potential VWAP, and not actual executed purchases. Essentially the full weighted value if everything was sold.”

Michael [also mentioned](https://aephia.com/star-atlas/progress-on-the-mini-game-and-roi/) that the ROI on ships is expected to be over 100% per ship per year net (after expenses). At least, in the initial period of the mini-game. However, this might still change or it can be adjusted if needed.

If you want to see all the VWAP’s for all the ships and compare them to their current market price – check out our [Star Atlas Ships](https://aephia.com/star-atlas-ships/) page. Aephia put together this great resource to help you find the best deals! Note that while earnings in the initial SCORE module are based on VWAP, future benefits from owning ships are more closely linked to their rarity and other characteristics. So choose wisely and keep in mind, that in future stages of the game, the role of the ship will play an important role.
