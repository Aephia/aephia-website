A short and sweet issue this week, as news and reveals from the team have quieted down a bit. Of course, we’re getting close to the big Community Week event (Feb 26 – March 1), and it’s widely expected that there will be some interesting announcements (if not actual releases) during that week! What we do have for this week is a new JNavigating Star Atlas episode, Joni nominations to vote on, and more DAC stats!

_Let’s dive in!_

## Navigating Star Atlas – Vehicles

Last week Tuesday, the community team released the [third episode](https://youtu.be/-aW_7IlJYhU) in their Navigating Star Atlas series. In this series, Dominic (Sr. Community Manager) virtually sits down with a team member. As such, it provides a more in-depth, behind-the-scenes perspective on Star Atlas game development.

For this third episode, Dominic sat down with Gary Sanchez (Vehicle Art Director). In the interview, the two discuss Gary’s background and how the team approaches working on the many ships and their in-game manufacturers.

## DAC Stats

[Last week](https://aephia.com/star-atlas/weekly-star-atlas-newsletter-116/), we highlighted the DAC analytics dashboard created by Steven Sabol. This week, we’ll go over some of the new DAC stats gathered by Aephia’s Data Runners. Since DAC registration went live, they have created two new dashboards:

* [DACS – SAGE Mining Operations](https://flipsidecrypto.xyz/Aephia/star-atlas-gameplay-analytics-star-atlas---gameplay-analytics-xGXyHF?tabIndex=5)  
Here, you can see a full breakdown of the mining operations per DAC. The table is sorted by total resources mined, making no distinction between the resources’ rarity, hardness, or value. Fortunately, all the individual resources are listed in the same table, and you can use the special sorting columns on the right to sort based on your preference.
* [DACS – Asset Ownership](https://flipsidecrypto.xyz/Aephia/star-atlas-global-overview-star-atlas---global-overview-dJhgb_?tabIndex=5)  
Perhaps the most requested metric since the launch of the DAC registration is VWAP ownership per guild. Note that besides the total VWAP, this table also lists the total VWAP in fighter ships, the total VWAP in SAGE and SCORE (Faction Fleet), Claim Stake VWAP, and more!

## Short News Bits

* We mostly do not cover community projects, but we want to make an exception for _Atlas Grace_ this week.  
In the wake of the sale of the limited edition PURI skin for the Ogrika Ruch, both the [team](https://x.com/staratlas/status/1758235769402204277?s=20) and [NeoSwap](https://x.com/NeoSwap_ai/status/1758562411538211323?s=20) have donated 10% of their respective proceeds from the sale of the PURI skin to [Atlas Grace](https://twitter.com/atlasgrace_), a community-ran initiative operated by well-known community member _Arktype_. He is putting his Star Atlas assets to good use by donating a portion of the tokens earned to various charities.
* The [COPA](https://medium.com/star-atlas/press-release-the-council-of-peace-assembly-copa-returns-for-its-second-edition-fda9507535b0) deadline for DACs to submit their pitch deck/presentation is looming. Guilds have until Wednesday, February 21st, 17:00 UTC (12 PM ET) to finalize their submission. Only **8 teams** will be allowed to present on stage during the COPA ’24 on February 29th.
* There will _not_ be an _Atlas Brew_ this Wednesday, February 21st, because the community team will be going over the submissions in order to be able to announce the 8 finalists at the end of the day.

## Sneak Peek

Unfortunately, there is little in the way of sneak peeks, but the team did release a short [teaser video of the Pearce T1 Titan ](https://youtu.be/cI5HUhABfJU)ship in a whitebox state in the Showroom.
