We had a very quiet week, with no official (minor) announcements of any kind. Fortunately, the team shared some nice visuals, Michael (CEO) was interviewed, and the Starvlog team published part 1 of their Singapore Report!

_It’ll be short but sweet!_

## A Peek Behind the UE5 Development Curtains 

Chip (Director of Game Systems Design) [shared a 30-second clip](https://x.com/Chypto_/status/1850575977597821067?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1850575977597821067%7Ctwgr%5E05ca7197ab2e59aee70722dddbf9cc53e8c3c690%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Faephia.com%2Fwp-admin%2Fpost.php%3Fpost%3D15591action%3Dedit) on X, showcasing his work on Server-Side Rewind for Hit Detection. This basically allows a player experiencing lag to still get their hits registered.

Been working on implementing Server-Side Rewind for Hit Detection the last few days. Really excited to have a prototype working! Client (small window) is operating with 1000ms packet lag. You can see on the Server their hits being validated based on the target frame history. [pic.twitter.com/sFhizLYU6i](https://t.co/sFhizLYU6i)

## PlayToEarn Interview

Michael did several interviews while in Singapore, and this past week, PlayToEarn shared their Token2049 interview with him on their [X account](https://x.com/PlayToEarn/status/1849783054509781430?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1849783054509781430%7Ctwgr%5Ed8712a75365e8616bec9073c601beb9bf6093ab3%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Faephia.com%2Fwp-admin%2Fpost.php%3Fpost%3D15591action%3Dedit) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQweu2Jt5Sc).

Though most of the information shared won’t be news to those following along closely, they do manage to cover a lot during the 30-minute window, and as such, we felt it worth sharing with all of you.

* In his [latest video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pocTjrectWo), Metaverse Explorer reviews a new Flipside Dashboard feature released by Aephia Industries that provides valuable insights into your SAGE performance.

## Starvlog – Part 1

Community members AtlasTheory (Content Creator) and Shaddix1 (Moderator) raised enough funds through a crowdfunding campaign to be able to travel to Singapore and document the Community meetups, Breakpoint, and IMPACT!

They have now [published the first of three parts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBAN8bvRyL0) (45 minutes) of their adventure on YouTube. If you did not manage to attend, or you’d like a bit of a nostalgia trip, you best give this one a look!
