Crew Cards are an entirely new asset class coming to Star Atlas! Plenty of these have been added over time (e.g., resources, structures), but this one is special!

In the UE5 Showroom, you can jump in on foot and then summon the _Floyd Line Aerospace One_ ship or any of the promotional _Free Flight_ ships to explore space. But in Star Atlas Golden Era (SAGE), you needed to at least own a ship of your own!

No more! After August 27th, you will need to own at least one Crew Card to do anything in SAGE. A ship by itself will not allow you to play the game anymore.

However, having only Crew Cards will severely limit your options in SAGE. To enjoy the full suite of gameplay that the game offers, you will absolutely need to own a ship as well.

Given its huge impact, we wrote this guide to get you fully up to speed on everything related to Crew in Star Atlas!

## Important Context

### Terminology

We can not discuss Crew without first clarifying some of the terms used. A _Crew Card_ is the NFT that you (can) own. A _Crew member_ is the representation of a Crew Card in-game\*. That said, both terms can be used interchangeably for nearly all intents and purposes.

\* note: UE5 support is forthcoming, but not yet here

### SFT vs NFT

An _NFT_ is a special kind of _token_ _._ It stands for _Non-Fungible Token_. This means that an NFT is unique. It can not be replaced by another, as there is no other like it.

All those other tokens, ATLAS, POLIS, USDC, etc, are _Fungible Tokens_. They can be replaced very easily, as they are not unique. If you exchange one USDC for another USDC, you would not be able to tell the difference. Nothing changed, really.

Fungible Tokens usually can be fractionalized. You can send someone 1.5 or 0.02 USDC, for example.

Another variant of this is called an SFT, or _Semi-Fungible Token_. All the ships and nearly all other Star Atlas assets you may possess are SFTs.

An SFT is still a Fungible Token but has a limitation: it can _not_ exist in fractions. This is why you can not give someone half a ship. Furthermore, an SFT is not unique like an NFT. You can exchange a Pearce X5 with another player for a Pearce X5, and neither party would be able to discern a difference. Nothing would really have changed.

While 99% of all Star Atlas assets are SFTs today (there were a handful of promotional items in the early days that are true NFTs), this is about to change with the Crew Card release.

Crew Cards are true NFTs (to be exact, they are _compressed_ NFTs—but let’s not go there for now). Each one is unique, and no two are alike, despite the total collection of cards being 6.2 million!

Star Atlas x Tensor

### Marketplace

Unfortunately, the current version (V2) of the Galactic Marketplace does not support NFTs. It has no support for uniqueness; it can only deal with (stacks of) SFTs. The team will spend the second half of 2024 creating a new version (V3) that will come with support for both SFTs and NFTs.

In the meantime, you can trade Crew Cards on [Tensor](https://www.tensor.trade/trade/staratlascrew) (and potentially other Solana NFT marketplaces).

Crew Cards – Tufa & Photoli – Anomaly Crew Cards

## Crew Card Collection

The team set everything up so that close to 6.2 million Crew Cards are mintable by the community. The first \~1.2 million have been airdropped to ship owners. The remaining 5 million Crew Cards are being sold in packs of 1 and 5, or given away through various partnerships and collaborations.

Considering all art elements (e.g., body, gender, skins, outfits, weapons, cosmetics, and backgrounds), the team could generate 347 million unique artworks for the crew cards.

Note that this art is just for this initial set of Crew Cards. In the future, the team will roll out additional art (outfits, at the very least) used for future specialty Crew Cards, such as the ones [created for racing](https://portal.productboard.com/staratlas/1-star-atlas-roadmap/c/167-tiers-0-5-racer-oni-mud-ustur).

Each Crew Card is rolled independently of other cards. Your chances for a higher rarity Crew Card do not go up (or down) depending on what rarity Crew Cards you pulled right before. 

When opening a Crew Pack, you have a very small chance to mint an Anomalous Crew Card. This card may be of the Faction you have selected, but there is a chance it will be from the _Tufa_ or _Photoli_ species instead.

### In-game Renders & Concept Art

Initially, the plan was to release only MUD characters, as the team had made a lot of progress there. However, after the community pushed back against that, the team decided to include all races in the initial Crew Card mint.

However, that posed a problem. There were myriad things for some of the races that did not yet exist in-engine. This is why these 6.2 million Crew Cards combine in-game renders and concept art.

All the base bodies were rendered in 3D, most of which took place inside the game engine. However, some of the female bodies were rendered in the modeling software as they were not ready yet. Then, for the humans, Mierese and Ustur, some of their outfits and accessories were also rendered in-game. That said, the majority of Crew Cards come with outfits and/or accessories that are Concept Art that was painted on top of the 3D renders.

## Utility

Before we dive in deeper, let’s briefly go over the anticipated utility of Crew Cards:

### August 27th

* **Crew in SAGE Labs: Starbased** — The most important use case in the short term is that you will need to deposit Crew Cards into Starbased to play the game. All the “temporary virtual” crew you had before will be removed.

### Future

* **Profile Picture (PFP) for your Player Profile** — This is displayed after you connect your wallet on the Play-portal, on leaderboards, and on anything the community builds that fetches your profile and shows your PFP. It may come in Q4, but that is uncertain.
* **Fleet Command (Q4)** — As Fleet Command is the UE5 version of Starbased, what goes for Starbased goes for Fleet Command. You need Crew Cards to play the game.
* **UE5 Showroom** — You will be able to use your Crew Card as your avatar at a later point in the _Preseason_ release. However, there will be many placeholder parts, as not every item exists in-game at that point (e.g., Punaabs won’t come until _Season 0_). Note that it is _not_ mandatory to own a Crew Card to play the various UE5 game modes.
* **Companion App (H1 2025)** — You can train the Fitness of a single Crew Card by slotting it into this app and then walking, running, or cycling while the app is active. This allows you to improve your game (racing, for starters) while not playing the game.

Though Star Atlas PFP functionality is not coming anytime soon, you can, of course, use a Crew Card’s art as your profile picture on external services such as X and Discord. In fact, the team is accommodating this through a _Download PFP_\-button in the Crew Cards interface.

Star Atlas Crew Packs – Rarity Aptitude Bonuses

## Crew Characteristics

Crew members come with a variety of attributes, such as:

* **Name** — The race will determine the way the name is structured
* [**OCEAN Personality Traits**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits) — Won’t play a role until later; the team has not yet defined their exact role
* **Background story** — A unique, in-lore, AI-generated background story for the Crew member _\[will come later!\]_
* **Aptitudes** — A set of minor, major, and/or anomalous Aptitudes
* **Other attributes** — Such as their age or education. Crew members in this initial collection have all been educated (raised) at their local Faction University. In the future, however, additional options will be available.

![Star Atlas Crew Cards](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/1150d030eae449562a2d4decd6b75cb4cfea9c762a82abd0278c9468e62053da.png)

Star Atlas Crew Cards

### Name

Every Crew member has a name that is structured differently depending on their race. Here is the full list:

* **MUD**: First name – Family name
* **Sogmian**: First name – Generation symbol they belong to – The noble house that they are aligned with
* **Mierese**: Their secret name – Their public name – The homeworld’s region their family comes from (originally)
* **Punaab**: First name – Last name (the longer the name, the more prominent the family)
* **Ustur**: Their name (a derivation of a collective noun unique to them) – Their degree of evolution in the Ustur [Seven Steps of Enlightenment](https://lore.staratlas.com/species-and-races/directory/ustur)

### Skills

Crew members can improve themselves in 8 different areas, called Skills. In the future, you will be able to assign your Crew members to specific crew stations on your ships. While that ship is active and that crew station is utilized, the crew member will earn Experience Points (XP). An alternative way to get them to earn XP is through the future mobile Companion app.

As with most RPGs, earning enough XP will level them up in that skill. Higher levels don’t improve the Crew member directly, but each new level achieved will reward a _Perk Point_ for that specific skill. Those Perk points can then be spent on any of the 4 _unlocked_ Perks that the team defined for each skill (see Perk section below).

The eight skills are:

* Command
* Flight
* Engineering
* Medical
* Science
* Operator
* Hospitality
* Fitness

### Crew Stations

The team made an effort to split out the crew stations according to the skill they would provide experience points for. It’s not complete, but it’s a start. You can find the [live document](https://lore.staratlas.com/ship-manufacturers-configurations-and-politics/ship-configuration/crew) here, but we copied the data below (as of August 9th, 2024) for your convenience as well:

* Command  
  * Admiral
  * Commander
  * Captain
* Flight  
  * Navigator
  * Pilot
* Engineering  
  * Engineering Officer
* Medical  
  * Medical Officer
* Science  
  * Science Officer
* Operator  
  * Weapons Operator
  * Drone Operator
  * Rig Operator
* Hospitality  
  * Chef
  * Mixologist
  * Entertainer

You may notice Fitness is missing. This is a special case, as the Mobile Companion App will provide an avenue to improve this skill. However, it could still be that in-game options will be added additionally.

### Aptitudes

The team’s goal with the Crew collection was to ensure there would be _no Pay-2-Win_ elements. That is why higher rarity Crew Cards do **_not_** have stat/ability bonuses. Instead, a crew with higher rarity will come with better/more _aptitudes_, which will not benefit them right out of the gate.

Every Crew member has an Aptitude for one or more of the aforementioned skills. These aptitudes can be minor, major, or anomalous, with this classification defining the XP gain bonus a crew member gets for that skill:

* **Minor Aptitude** – +25% XP gain bonus
* **Major Aptitude** – +50% XP gain bonus
* **Anonamalous** – +100% XP gain bonus

This means that for every _base_ 100 XP earned for a specific skill, Crew members would earn the following real XP based on their aptitude for that skill:

* No Aptitude: 100 XP
* Minor Aptitude: 125 XP
* Major Aptitude: 150 XP
* Anomalous Aptitude: 200 XP

When a Crew Card is minted, its _Rarity_ will be determined. This will influence both the artwork and the amount and type of Aptitudes the card will be receiving:

* **Common** – 1 Major Aptitude
* **Uncommon** – 1 Major & 1 Minor Aptitudes
* **Rare** – 1 Major & 2 Minor Aptitudes
* **Epic** – 2 Major & 1 Minor Aptitudes
* **Legendary** – 3 Major Aptitudes
* **Anomalous** – All Minor Aptitudes, or 2 Major & 1 Anomalous Aptitude

Note that the specific skills for which a Crew member will get aptitude bonuses are randomly determined.

![Crew Card Aptitudes](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/53c2acfc1337553e1280d2129a4c247bb8d82a32e7ceef034602c88ab2c4e8a0.webp)

Star Atlas Crew Cards – Aptitudes & Perks

### Perks

The team has defined 4 different Perks for each of the 8 skills, as can be seen in the above image. The skills are the golden titles beneath each Skill name, and the number to their left shows what Skill level needs to be achieved to unlock that specific Perk.

An unlocked Perk does not do anything in itself. Instead, you’ll have to spend Perk Points on them in order to unlock gameplay bonuses in both SAGE and Star Atlas. Note that every skill comes with a Perk that unlocks at level 1 to ensure the points can be spent and a bonus unlocked from level 1 and onward.

The bonuses all provide a bonus to some of the calculations made as part of the gameplay. Things can go faster, longer, cheaper, with better odds, etc. You can spend an unlimited amount of points on each Perk. There is no limitation. However, there are diminishing returns.

### Diminishing returns

The first point spent on a Perk will offer the greatest relative value. The next point spent will improve the bonus, but (relatively speaking) to a lesser extent. In fact, each subsequent point invested in a Perk will yield a smaller incremental change to the bonus than the point that was invested before. In other words, investing points into the same Perk has _diminishing returns_. Every point invested will improve the bonus, but the extent to which it does so is ever-_decreasing_.

### Teamwork

Contrary to what you may expect, bonuses such as those given by Perks do not only apply to a ship when a crew member is assigned to the related crew station. For example, a crew member with 10 Perk points invested into the _Navigation_ perk of the _Flight_ aptitude is providing their bonus, whether or not they are in the pilot seat. And yes, that means _it matters not whether you have assigned your best pilot to scrub the ship’s decks and the concierge to the pilot seat or vice versa_!

Every ship’s crew operates as a team. They pool their collective expertise and skills together to ensure the ship performs optimally!

That is not to say that assignment does not matter. A Crew member will only earn XP in a specific skill if they are assigned to a related crew station on an _active_ ship.

### Synergy

What happens when two or more crew members on a ship have both spent Perk points on the same Perk, resulting in both of them giving a bonus to a specific ship feature?

**They stack!**

You can simply sum up those bonuses to establish the bonus they together will provide to their ship.

This design choice, combined with the diminishing returns on Perk bonuses, dramatically impacts how you will value a Crew Card’s rarity. This is why, beyond aesthetics, **higher rarity Crew Cards are valuable**!

Due to diminishing returns, two Crew members who each put 5 points into the same Perk will collectively provide a better bonus than a single Crew member who has put 10 points into that same Perk.

This means that assigning a Crew member to a single Crew station and leaving them there forever is not the best way to boost the bonuses your crew can give your ship. A better strategy would be to rotate them so you can get multiple crew members to level up specific perks. This would result in them providing a greater cumulative bonus together.

The moment when you want to rotate (some) members will likely depend on their aptitude bonuses. For example, two Crew members who both have a major Flight aptitude should probably be swapped in and out of the pilot’s seat whenever one has out-leveled the other in that skill.

Boiling it down to the essence, **a team of generalists is better than a team of specialists**.

![Star Atlas Crew Card [Example] - High Punaab](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/4a6b8195a120f610d5c40d22299637a55cda6c0e66eb542aa54efde8150ce84c.jpg)

Star Atlas Crew Card \[Example\] – High Punaab

### Accessories

Crew members sometimes hold/wear items such as goggles and weapons. In the future, you will be able to customize your crew by replacing those items or simply taking them out.

In other words, if you don’t like what your Crew member is wearing/holding but you like some other stuff that another Crew Card is sporting, you will be able to exchange those items at a later date!

So, don’t just look at the overall picture! Look for cool accessories as well!

### Age

All crew members have a Starting Age, and each (real life) year, they get one year older (this is not visualized on the NFT—the team used the “starting” age for a reason).
But while this means the crew will age, the team has no plans to let them die (yet).

## Distribution

Let’s go briefly over the rarity distributions and the actual Crew Packs that will be handed out.

### Rarity Distributions

There are three different rarity distributions:

**Silver**

* Common: **86.57%**
* Uncommon: **8.66%**
* Rare: **4.33%**
* Epic: **0.43%**
* Legendary: **0.009%**
* Anomaly: **0.00004%**

**Gold**

* Common: **0%**
* Uncommon: **86.84%**
* Rare: **8.68%**
* Epic: **4.34%**
* Legendary: **0.130%**
* Anomaly: **0.00043%**

**Platinum**

* Common: **0%**
* Uncommon: **0%**
* Rare: **90.09%**
* Epic: **9.01%**
* Legendary: **0.901%**
* Anomaly: **0.00495%**

As you can see, the Silver distribution is heavily skewed towards common rarity cards. Gold is skewed to uncommon but will never give common rarity cards. Platinum will get you Rare crew cards 9 out of 10 times but will not give you common and uncommon cards.

The above numbers should roughly result in people minting about 50 Anomaly Crew Cards and 10,000 Legendary ones. These numbers are not fixed, however. The rarity is determined randomly (using the above-mentioned weights), and therefore, there could be a few more or less.

### Crew Pack Distribution

There are a total of 7 different Crew Packs that you will be able to unpack starting August 13th:

* **\[Limited edition\] Special edition Platinum Packs** — This pack allows you to mint **10 Crew Cards** using the Platinum rarity distribution. It was sold out in 24 hours following its [release](https://medium.com/star-atlas/a-new-release-on-the-horizon-star-atlas-crew-packs-coming-in-q2-2024-e2603415bc65) on May 11th, 2024.
* **Silver Crew Pack (sale)** — This pack allows you to mint **5 Crew Cards** using the Silver rarity distribution. It will be sold starting August 13th for $25 USDC each.
* **Gold Crew Pack (sale)** — This pack allows you to mint **5 Crew Cards** using the Gold rarity distribution. It will be sold starting August 13th for $37.50 USDC each.
* **Platinum Crew Pack (sale)** — This pack allows you to mint **5 Crew Cards** using the Platinum rarity. It will be sold starting August 13th for $50 USDC each.
* **Silver Crew Pack (airdrop)** — This pack allows you to mint **1 Crew Card** using the Silver rarity distribution. It will be claimable in your inventory on August 9th.
* **Gold Crew Pack (airdrop)** — This pack allows you to mint **1 Crew Card** using the Gold rarity distribution. It will be claimable in your inventory on August 9th.
* **Platinum Crew Pack (airdrop)** — This pack allows you to mint **1 Crew Card** using the Platinum rarity distribution. It will be claimable in your inventory on August 9th.

If this is a bit much, so we also put the above data into a table as well:

| **Type**                                              | **Cards Inside** | **Rarity Distribution** | **Available**         | **Distribution** |

### Presale

The team held a special presale event (described in [this article](https://medium.com/star-atlas/a-new-release-on-the-horizon-star-atlas-crew-packs-coming-in-q2-2024-e2603415bc65)) directly after Michael’s [presentation](https://www.youtube.com/live/wilFLhdkyy8?si=ARcv0fFU5miuWB-2&t=26819) at Solana Crossroad on May 11th, where he announced the Crew Packs. 5000 special edition platinum packs, each containing 10 Crew Cards, were offered at 90 USDC each. This batch sold out within 24 hours.

### Pre-existing Crew SFTs

In addition to the 7 Crew Packs, 5 existing Crew SFTs that act like Crew Packs and can be “opened” as well.

All Crew SFTs function like Crew Packs of 1\. You’ll get an identical copy (now an NFT) with the same name that is still of the same rarity, but they’ll get their own randomly rolled set of OCEAN attributes and Aptitudes.

You’ll be able to convert/open the following Crew Card SFTs starting August 13th:

* [Anna Tolle](https://play.staratlas.com/market/HzeBiGCyGESHS3d5ndQmvz7q7Nz8Py6PV5xFjRL4cQGk/?symbol=ATLAS) — Part of the Rebirth rewards (2021)

Star Atlas Crew Card \[Example\] – Mierese

## Airdrop

The team dropped close to 1.2 million **_single-crew_** Crew Packs to a few thousand Solana accounts.

On August 8th, the team took a snapshot of all ships on the Solana chain (@ 3 PM EST / 19:00 UTC / 21:00 CEST). If these ships were:

* in your wallet
* in Starbased (SAGE)
* in Faction Fleet (SCORE)
* on the Galactic Marketplace (for sale)

then they were eligible for the Crew Airdrop. 

Every ship that was in an eligible location at the time of the snapshot dropped you the following claimable items to your _Inventory_ on August 9th:

* A single _component bundle_ (specifically for that ship) – See _Appendix B_ for more on this
* A [number of crew packs](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1opuzxtZtIW6PntptsjKZtpjAoJwRipupaERzOUSUCPs/edit?gid=0#gid=0) equal to the number of crew slots present on the ship. Note that these packs only contain a single Crew Card each!

As with previous airdrops, these packs were not dropped directly to the wallets, but were instead claimable through the Play-portal’s Inventory screen.

Months before the airdrop took place, the team had communicated which rarity distribution the airdropped packs would receive. This was depended on the rarity of the ship in question:

* **Common & Uncommon**: Silver Crew Pack
* **Rare & Epic**: Gold Crew Pack
* **Legendary & Anomaly**: Platinum Crew Pack

Airdropped Crew Packs are different from other Crew Packs in that they contain a single Crew Card only.

When visiting the Crew Packs tab in the new Crew Card section in the Play-portal, these packs can be accessed by clicking a stack with the matching rarity. In the follow-up screen, the packs will be split up depending on the number of Crew Cards they contain.

### Final Ship Airdrop Numbers

A few days before the airdrop, the team released a [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1opuzxtZtIW6PntptsjKZtpjAoJwRipupaERzOUSUCPs/edit?gid=0#gid=0) listing the definitive number of Crew Cards (Packs) that would be dropped per ship. This showed that the team had decided to tweak (and slightly buff) three of the transport ships. They had communicated these ships required two crew members, and they would receive two Crew Cards each, but only one crew would be needed to control the ship moving forward. These affected ships:

* Fimbul Lowbie
* Ogrika Niruch
* Calico Maxhog

Though the team initially expected to airdrop \~2.5 million Crew Cards (in single-crew Crew Packs), that number proved too high. They sent out \~1.2 million (1,193,860) Crew Cards instead.

### Ship Pricing Post Airdrop

With Crew and Components now stripped from all ships on the Galactic Marketplace, these assets now represent their hull and a built-in set of Tier 0 components (excluding weapons and modules).

However, as these drops were bonuses to those who bought a ship up till now, the team did not update the price for which they were selling any ships themselves. Of course, the community did respond on the secondary market, with some ships dropping considerably in price right after the snapshot was taken.

### No Referral Rewards

There will be **no referral rewards** active for Crew Packs. The team has not commented on why, but it is known that they hope to boost their war chest with this sale.

![crew sneakpeek2](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/1b7a0ba589dd04fad4043c5672c0dc04ec305f2743cc829516cb60d2645b6e21.png)

Star Atlas Crew Cards – The “Crew / My Crew Cards” interface on the website

## Opening Packs

A new menu option has been added to the Play portal/website: [Crew](https://play.staratlas.com/crew/). This will open an interface with two tabs: _My Crew Cards_ and _Crew Packs_. The first tab will show you all the Crew Cards in your wallet (so not in Starbased). The second one will give you an overview of all the Crew Packs your wallet contains (and allow you to buy more).

![Star Atlas - Crew - Card Packs](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/ecf22dcb780d9ebc5e26c0154a78018638795c2bc0bdc41bfd07501848f93c49.png)

Star Atlas – Crew – Card Packs

This will also be where you can open up your Crew Packs. On the initial screen, the packs will show by rarity, so you will see (up to) only three different items. Unless you also own one or more Crew Card SFTs, then there will be another item to the right called _Other_.

You first click the type (rarity) of Crew packs you want to open, after which you will be able to select the amount of packs you want to open in one go, up to 5000\. Opening Crew Packs comes with a cool animation to make the experience more memorable. Beyond selecting the number of packs to open, there are two important settings you need to look into:

![Star Atlas - Crew - Card Packs [opening step 1]](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/5664bfba318058b7e91fd8e88174bd078fc806ebf5a1a052600438dfea5f59ce.png)

Star Atlas – Crew – Card Packs \[opening step 1\]

* **Transfer Crew Directly to SAGE**\* — You can automatically transfer your revealed Crew Cards into SAGE Labs Starbased. This is a huge time-saver, as otherwise, you would have to insert your crew manually, up to three per transaction. Unlike your ship SFTs, moving unique NFTs around is a more complex endeavor. Make sure you do not forget to toggle this before opening the packs!
* **Faction** — You can select the faction (MUD, ONI, or Ustur) for this specific opening action. _All non-anomaly Crew Cards revealed will be of the chosen faction_. You can also choose to keep it mixed by selecting _All_. When you do, the faction (race) will be determined randomly.

\* When you choose to move your Crew Cards into SAGE this way, they will not show up in your My Crew Cards list. SAGE has a more limited interface for browsing through Crew Cards, but the team is working to expand the My Crew Cards section with Crew inside SAGE as well.

![Star Atlas - Crew - Crew Packs [opening step 3]](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/0fee9382de4307c7ff49176fe0064ff9e65b8434d57aba387a473a63b283b4ab.png)

Star Atlas – Crew – Crew Packs \[opening step 3\]

### Faction Choice

The choice of Faction has led to some confusion. You can select the Faction from which your non-anomalous crew will originate. But what you are really doing is selecting the (mix of) species that you like to get. It just so happens that these species are commonly associated with a specific Faction.

Though every Faction has its native species, there is nothing preventing a Mierese crew member from joining the MUD Faction or working on MUD ships (i.e., Pearce).

No matter which faction you are playing in or the ships you own, you can use Crew Cards from any and all species in both SAGE and Star Atlas. Once again, you can put a Sogmian (ONI) Crew member inside your Pearce (MUD manufacturer) ship while being a player for the Ustur faction (account).

### No Faction/Ship Synergies

There are **no** (lost) bonuses or future benefits/disadvantages to mixing races on a ship. Previously, the team planned to give crew members a small bonus when operating equipment created by a manufacturer aligned with their faction. This idea has meanwhile been discarded.

**Species are purely cosmetic**! Instead, manufacturer proficiencies will now have to be trained individually. That training would either occur on the ship (on the job) or at a university aligned with the manufacturer’s faction. A VZUS ship filled with MUD humans performs the same as if it were filled with Ustur. What matters is their (future) training.

### Trading

As mentioned earlier, The individual Crew Cards are NFTs, and the Galactic Marketplace does not support trading them. So, while Crew Packs, Component Bundles, and Ships are all tradable on the Galactic Marketplace, Crew Cards have to be temporarily traded on external marketplaces. The team has made a deal with [Tensor](https://www.tensor.trade/trade/staratlascrew) to be the official platform for trade until the team manages to launch V3 of their own marketplace, which they hope to accomplish in Q4 of this year.

## SAGE — Tuesday, August 27th

Before August 27th, if you are playing SAGE Labs: Starbase, make sure that :

* _All_ your crafts have been finished
* _All_ your fleets have unloaded _all_ their Fuel, Ammo, and Cargo
* You moved your Crew Cards into SAGE

On August 27th, **16:00 UTC**, the team will:

* Forcefully disband all remaining fleets
* Burn all cargo & R4 still present on such fleets
* Move all ships to the CSS
* Strip all “virtual” crew members from the game
* Update the necessary on-chain programs to support Crew Cards

It is, therefore, important you prepare for this event by bringing the new crew members into the game (if not during the opening of packs, then at least afterward).

Note that skills and aptitudes play **no role** whatsoever in Starbased. Crafting will not level up a skill. Leveling up Crew members will not come to SAGE for quite a while. This feature will instead go live in Season 0 when Racing is coming to the UE5 Showroom.

![Crew - Faction Leader Campaign](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/68bb3023e376caa39d8f1812a8e505773064902470cf5cd9e0533d5e44d7fb4f.png)

Crew – Faction Leader Campaign

## Appendix A: Faction Leaders

The team has come up with the cool idea of distributing the 3 Faction Leaders to the players! This will happen through a raffle at a future date after the Crew Sale has gone live. Everyone who owns at least one set of common to legendary (so, including all 5 rarities) crew cards from a single faction will participate in the raffle for that faction’s leader. Every such set will represent a single raffle ticket.

There will be one winner for each Faction, and they will be getting:

* Anomalous Crew member – The Faction leader
* A unique (1-of-1) ship (large)
* Exclusive access to a unique (1-of-1) Tier 5 habitat on the Faction’s CSS
* Dedicated office space at The Cradle (Council of Peace space station)

The important part: Access to all these things will be revoked after the 1-year term is up, and another raffle will take place. The one thing you’ll keep is the anomalous crew member, who is no longer the faction leader. See the above image for more details!

Star Atlas – Crew Card artwork – Female Mierese (ONI)

## Appendix B: Ship Component Bundle

**IMPORTANT:** Ships acquired **after** the snapshot will **NOT** come with their component bundle or Crew cards!

Any ship SFT you buy _after_ the snapshot will represent that ship’s **hull**, along with a base complement of built-in Tier 0 components that are required to ensure the ship is flyable. Note that this does **not include components such as weapons or modules**!

Though the crew and Tier1+ components have now been stripped, the ship remains flyable with the default Tier 0 components it comes with. Note that it will not be possible to ever remove these Tier 0 components. They are simply baked into the hull. Replacing them with Tier 1+ components later will not result in a Tier 0 component.

You can still use just a ship SFT in the UE5 Showroom without any issues for now. However, the same can not be said for SAGE. In SAGE, you will need to bring an additional complement of Crew Cards to use a ship.

Note that the Component Bundles you will receive are **placeholders**. Not only that, you also _won’t_ _need_ them anytime soon, and you certainly _can’t use_ them anywhere, either. But don’t trade these away too easily, as each bundle contains all of the fancy components you paid for when you originally acquired the ship (before the snapshot).

### Bundle Contents

Below are the components included in each ship’s component bundle. Around the time when [Ship Configuration](https://portal.productboard.com/staratlas/1-star-atlas-roadmap/c/170-onchain-ship-configuration) goes live, the team will publish a conversion program where you can “open up” the Component bundle and get the individual Component NFTs dropped to you (much like Crew Packs).

Star Atlas – Component Bundle content for each ship

The team released an [in-depth article](https://medium.com/star-atlas/into-the-shipyard-exploring-the-ships-framework-in-star-atlas-270f41e5b1be) that goes a little deeper into all of this.
