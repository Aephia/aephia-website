## News

Spaceship Galleries are now available on the [Galactic Marketplace](https://t.co/YwjoQtzCPm?amp=1). Browse different images, ranging from action shots, interiors, and schematics, of your favorite ships. 

Star Atlas, in partnership with [Audius Project](https://twitter.com/AudiusProject), launched the [Cosmic Groove Music Contest](https://twitter.com/staratlas/status/1455156921607000069). Submit your piece and get a chance to win exclusive merch, Pearce X4 & X5 spaceships, and a sneak peak at Star Atlas!

## Gameplay

For the mini game, ships will function when sent on ship missions as long as resources are maintained. All ships have a range of efficiencies and deficiencies, leading to different opportunity costs. The time requirement in allocating resources to ships will require interaction and will depend on the size of the ships. 

Decommissioning/salvaging more common or smaller ships, such as the Opal Jet or Pearce X4, to yield materials is a feature. However, salvaged materials from these ships won’t automatically suffice to build a ship on the next tier. Higher-end items will require some unique materials that need to be secured through the mining process.

## Assets

The team stated that ship rarity will be tied dynamically to actual total supply when ship manufacturing comes online. It is not tied directly to the stats and specs breakdown of each ship but it is a starting point. This aligns with what makes sense for the intended future gameplay in regards to the attractiveness of cosmetics as well as the features of each ship. It will be up to the open market where the price falls and this will depend on the utility in the final game. That utility is basically unpredictable until the final game stats settle after long periods of play testing.

All GAO ships come with filled crew/component/module slots. In the game, new ships will be barebones and only limited components are bespoke and fixed. You can detach all these GAO filler items and sell them, and respec individually and accordingly.

There are several x-small and xx-small ships that have been completed or close to completion. These will be an array of starter ships that will entice entry-level people. Supply of the current and future x-small and xx-small ships will be increased as needed. 

Four new ships will be released this week: Rainbow Om, Pearce R8, VZUS ambwe, and Pearce C9. Visit the Galactic Marketplace for more information. Be sure to mark your calendars and set your alarms.

## DAO

For those who are planning on staking POLIS in the game and by actively participating in the DAO, keep in mind that the DAO structure is separate from NFT asset yields which means that the rate of return will vary.  It will be highly variable depending on the number of people that participate in staking and governance. Also, the hierarchy of DAOs will all have disparate return profiles, depending on many factors. Notably, the economy of a particular faction or region, ands well as the general growth of GDP within the metaverse. There will be base emission yields, which change based on participation but the cost components inside the metaverse are captured by the master DAO. The returns in the master DAO will increase as the users and activity inside the metaverse expands.

## Development

Michael Wagner, the CEO himself, recently teased a possible feature for those of you who are talented in concept and design. The team is looking at developing a design standard for ships that has to be maintained for independent content creators who want to release assets, to retain the visual integrity of the game. Beyond that, the DAO would be responsible for voting on what can get listed in the game.

## Tokens

ATLAS can now be used as a way to buy available ships from the [GAO](https://staratlas.com/gao-brochure.pdf) in the marketplace. The price in ATLAS is based on the current USDC exchange rate at the time of listing. Orders will be updated occasionally (likely weekly) to reflect volatility in the exchange rate.

POLIS rewards from staking in the DAO will be released periodically. This depends on the term of the contract to which you are staked. 30 days on shorter contracts, and 90 days on the longer term contracts.

## Wallets

Ledger will function properly for ship enlistment. They just don't currently support the signMessage function, which means you can't update your profile image or badge.
