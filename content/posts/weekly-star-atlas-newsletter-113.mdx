Last week was the team’s second workweek of the year, and it came with some interesting events! Stealing the spotlight, the very first Unreal Engine 5 multiplayer stress test took place, offering Star Atlas enthusiasts a glimpse into the future! Beyond that, the ATLAS side of the market was repriced following the decline of the ATLAS token’s value these past few weeks. And lastly, a new ship was pre-announced!

_Let’s jump right in!_

UE5 – Star Atlas Multiplayer Test #1

## UE5 Multiplayer Test

Last Wednesday, at 17:00 UTC, the team kicked off their very first UE5 multiplayer test. To that end, they updated the Epic Game Store client with a new one that offered a new game mode specifically for this event.

With the test spanning a _24-hour window_, nearly everyone had a chance to log on and explore the new build. But for the purpose of stress-testing the multiplayer mode, this proved not very helpful. The largest number of simultaneous online users, around 150, was measured around the time of the Atlas Brew, which started one hour after the test launched. Besides the Brew, the team organized two ad-hoc events to try and get more people to be online concurrently. The community team played hide-and-seek to thank those participating, rewarding a few lucky participants with Fimbul Lowbies and some XXS ships.

UE5 – Star Atlas Multiplayer Test #1

Despite the number of users online not reaching 1000 by a long shot, the team still managed to gather a lot of data. In addition, they’ve also learned lessons on how to organize these events better in the future.

Talking about the future, another multiplayer test should be coming relatively soon!

### Contractual Obligations

Some obvious glitches occurred during the test, such as client crashes, people getting stuck while spawning, seemingly teleporting around the map, or walking through the air. Most of these issues were known in advance, but Danny (CPO) shared\* that the team had contractual obligations with Meta Gravity to launch the test by that date. This meant that they could not afford a delay to iron out the “crash, optimizations, replication, and fun issues”.

### Atlas Brew Interview with MetaGravity

You may want to check the [recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMRHIK6Q8s4) if you missed the last Atlas Brew (#95). Rashid Mansoor, the CEO and Founder of MetaGravity was being interviewed, and he provided a few interesting glimpses into how their approach to supporting multiplayer differs from the few alternatives out there.

## ATLAS Markets Repriced

This past Friday, the team repriced the ATLAS side of their offerings on the Galactic Marketplace to bring prices in line (at least for the moment) with USDC again. Since their last _repeg_\-event (the more technical term for these ATLAS-USDC reprices) on December 4th, 2023, ATLAS lost a decent amount of value, making ships sold by the team on the ATLAS side of the market a much better deal than their USDC counterparts.

It, therefore, made sense to reprice the ATLAS side now to get prices back in line with the team’s intentions. This repeg also makes sense in the context of the team preparing to launch a new ship soon…

## New Ship: Fimbul Sledbarge

The team announced the upcoming release of a brand new ship, the _Fimbul Sledbarge_! This is a pre-announcement, as no date was provided yet, nor was there any information on pricing.

We know that the Sledbarge is a _capital freighter_, a ship that -at least on paper- is highly desirable now that some people struggle to transport their mined resources back to the Central Space Station.

Chip (Director of Game Systems Design) updated the [ship specification spreadsheet to include the upcoming](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cfzW3uiqkbnfJexBysh0MAzZYRhiRwQg8WlsFWfuKgs/edit#gid=205337066) ship’s various scores/ratings. Below we list some of the scores that may interest you:

* Cargo Capacity: 608,838
* Subwarp Speed: 0.0026 (1019.32 Fuel/AU)
* Warp Speed: 0.1 (3710.31 Fuel/AU)
* Max Warp Distance: 13.5 AU
* Base Warp Cooldown: 420

This being a Fimbul ship, it will be the cheapest Capital freighter sold by the team and likely into perpetuity, as it should be the easiest to craft in the future as well.

We’ll likely learn more about this ship when it is properly announced, and it looks like this may happen this week!

_Note:_ When this ship goes on sale, you will not be able to sell it on the secondary market for the first 30 days, as per the new policy that went into effect with the sale of the Opal Rayfam.

## Sneak Peeks

The team showed off a fancy new animation for the Opal Jet ship on [X.com](https://twitter.com/staratlas/status/1748435896465265146), which we uploaded in [HD to YouTube](https://youtu.be/t2eF8JJSPcs) for your viewing pleasure. The animation shows the ship taking off for flight and subsequently landing.

Furthermore, the team shared an in-engine look at the XXS Calico Energy Rapidfire:

We’ve also got some new fully modeled and lit-up images showing off the VZUS solos:

Lastly, the team did not just show off the VZUS solos; they also shared a bunch of high-quality Ogrika Niruch beauty shots:
