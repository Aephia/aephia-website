Community Week 2025 has wrapped, marking another high-energy celebration of everything Star Atlas! From the thrilling Team vs Community UE5 battles to the Joni Awards and COPA presentations, the event was packed with action, recognition, and fun.

The UE5 Summer Patch also launched, featuring improvements like polished gameplay, progression via EOS, and the introduction of Play-to-Earn mechanics. Meanwhile, the Holosim Beta closed, with Ustur taking the crown in Season 0, and with the top 1000 players earning a cosmetic badge. Lastly, don’t miss the upcoming community meetups in Valencia, Utrecht, and Cologne this August!

_Let’s dive in!_

## Community Week ’25

The second-ever Community Week took place this past week, in the middle of summer, and it looks to have been a major success! Kudos to the Community Team for all the time and effort they put in!

We’ll go into the major events below, but let’s start with a short highlight of a new event this year, the _UE5 Team vs Community battles_.

### UE5 – Team vs Community

One of the new additions to this year’s Community Week was the Team vs Community UE5 Surge battles. The team played eight games against community teams with straightforward rules: whoever got to 30 points first, or had the highest score after 10 minutes, would win. One of the absolute highlights was the comeback of the team in their game against Coexist. In less than a minute, the team managed to fight their way back up, all the way to 29-29, and then scored the last point needed right before Coexist could.

After losing to them during the community-organized Iris’ Quest, this was a great revenche match!

Also worthy of mentioning here is that there was only one team that managed to win against the team, and that was **Quimera**‘s first team (they participated with both their A and B teams).

This whole event proved to be a spectacular new addition to the Community Week!

Community Week 25 – COPA

## COPA

The 2025 edition of COPA took place on Tuesday this past week. The 10 guild finalists each had 10 minutes to present their vision and progress.

In the end, the judges decided on the following top placements:

1. **Star Atlas Italia** (SAI)
2. **BULK**
3. **Aephia Industries** (AEP)

The differences were minimal, with there being a 1-point difference between each subsequent pair in the top-4 positions. Therefore, an honorable mention for Quimera, as they ended in 4th place.

Star Atlas Summer – Town Hall Pt. 1 – UE5 Summer Patch

## Town Hall – UE5 Summer Patch

The Town Hall was almost entirely focused on the launch of the UE5 Summer Patch, bringing features such as:

* Progression (off-chain, using Epic Online Services)
* Fully polished Paizul’s Arena
* Various gunplay improvements
* Dedicated servers
* Missions in the Galia mode

As always, StarAtlasTV [recorded the Town Hall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayks1J41_ok), and we wrote a [written report](https://aephia.com/star-atlas/town-hall-report-july-30th-2025/) if you prefer to read through the highlights quickly.

Before the team jumped into the UE5 update, they officially released the first of 3 cinematics that led up to the launch of Season 0\. Check out this [3-minute clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7F911FuYX-g) (with updated audio compared to the IMPACT Summit preview) now!

### Play-to-Earn

Play-to-Earn is back! You can now play UE5 and earn Crew Packs based on your skill and dedication.

The _Join Session_ screen now displays a list of dedicated sessions across the different regions in the world. Here, you will find sessions for two weekly game modes that you can join, one for _Gunplay_ and one for _Racing_.
**To earn XP**, you need to log in with a wallet, and you need to be playing in one of these two matchmaking sessions. The XP earned in both gunplay and racing is the same, so you can choose the mode that fits you best!

XP earned is tied to a **Character Group** (species & gender pair). There are 14 groups in total, and you’ll need to work on several to get access to the rewards:

1. Human Male
2. Human Female
3. Mierese Male
4. Mierese Female
5. Sogmian Male
6. Sogmian Female
7. High Punaab Male
8. High Punaab Female
9. Profound Punaab Male
10. Profound Punaab Female
11. Ustur .1
12. Ustur .2
13. Tufa
14. Photoli

To earn any of the rewards, you need to have reached certain Prestige levels. When you level up a character group to max level (20), you will earn one prestige level, and the normal level will reset back to 1, allowing you to level up the character group again, earning you the second prestige level.

The following rewards can be earned:

* **Silver 5 Card Pack** — Level 20 (Prestige 1) with 4 different character groups
* **Gold 5 Card Pack** — Level 20 (Prestige 1) with 8 different character groups
* **Platinum 5 Card Pack** — Level 20 (Prestige 1) with 12 different character groups
* **Diamond 5 Card Pack** — Prestige 10 times across 12 different character groups (this pack starts with Crew Card rarity at epic)

In short, you are not levelling up a Crew Card. Instead, you are levelling up the Character Group the Crew Card belongs to. This progress is not stored on-chain, but is instead stored inside Epic Online Services (EOS).

**Note**: Ledgers are currently not yet supported in UE5\. Please move the Crew Card(s) you mean to use in-game to a hot wallet and connect this one to the game. As progress is not stored on-chain at this moment, you are not losing out on anything by doing it this way for now. The team is working with a 3rd party to get proper support set up.

## Holosim Beta Finale

The Holosim beta ended this past week, though the game is still live and will remain that way until close to the launch of the first real season.

The **Ustur** faction managed to redeem the most contracts during the period the beta was live, just edging out MUD. As such, they are the winners of Season 0! Below is the final tally:

1. **USTUR** — 34,134,755 POINTS
2. **MUD** — 29,869,593 POINTS
3. **ONI** — 11,057,775 POINTS

Looking at players, **\[AEP\] Lerinor** took the top spot on the leaderboard, followed directly by **\[CATain\] Shadowmoon** and ****\*Solaris\* 0siris**. It was a super tight race till the very end:

1. **\[AEP\] Lerinor** — 225.372.794 XP
2. **\[CATain\] Shadowmoon** — 225.215.011 XP
3. **\*Solaris\* 0siris** — 224.500.979 XP

### Rewards

The team shared the following regarding what you can expect as rewards:

> Gold, Silver, and Bronze badges will be awarded to the Top 10, Top 300 and Top 1000 respectively (with a few exceptions).
> 
> As you may know some players found and executed various exploits throughout the open beta. While this might have been frustrating to some, it was very helpful for our team to see these exploits first hand so we could address them. Rather than exclude those players from the leaderboad completely, they will get to keep their rewards, but their spot on the leaderboard will be shared with the next person in line. This way, someone who was using an exploit won’t bump someone else to another lower reward tier.
> 
> For example, if a player who was flagged for using exploits ranked #7 on the leaderboard, they will still get the “Gold” badge, but the Gold and Silver tiers will include one extra spot. So the player who is ranked #11 on the leaderboard will also get a Gold badge, and the player who is ranked #301 will get a silver badge.
> 
> Cosmetic badges will only be awarded to players who have linked a mainnet wallet to their Holosim account using the in-game settings menu before 23:59:59 UTC August 11th. So make sure you’ve linked your wallet! Rewards will be airdropped to that linked address later that week.

To make this extra clear: **If you want a reward, make sure to have supplied your wallet address before August 12th (UTC)**

Community Week 25 – Community Carnival

## Community Carnival

A new feature introduced to the second Community Week was the _Community Carnival_. The whole week, community members could earn tickets through various activities, which were then used in raffles taking place on Saturday.

The community could play regular _Rumble Royal_ and _Gartic_ team, hosted by moderators. They could challenge each other with _Rock, Paper, Scissors_, and they could gamble against the bot itself. All of these activities allowed them to earn carnival tickets (often requiring them to put these on the line first). On top, the team gave away codes you could claim during the main events, and you could predict the winners of various events and earn tickets from those who bet on the wrong outcome.

All in all, the tickets significantly boosted Discord server activity, and many had a lot of fun challenging each other and seeking more ways to gain tickets.

On Saturday, during another live event, the community team wrapped up the Community Week with twelve drawings, one for each of the prize categories on the above poster.

**Note:** If you missed it and want to know if you won anything, please head to the Star Atlas Discord and check the [#sola-qint-bot](https://discord.com/channels/789226204980707409/1396964535369203803/1401265410732462185) channel.

And with that, the Community Week of 2025 was a wrap!
