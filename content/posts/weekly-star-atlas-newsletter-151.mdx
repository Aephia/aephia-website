After a month-long election, the first Star Atlas DAO Council has been chosen! There were some last-minute surprises, likely the result of the debate that took place two days before the second round of voting closed. In other news, the Golden Ticket recipe for 2024 has been revealed.

_It’s a short one this week, so let’s dive in right away!_

## Governance – Council Elections

This past Friday, the first-ever Star Atlas DAO Council elections concluded! It was an exciting race, especially with all the votes being registered transparently for all to see while allowing anyone to change their vote up until the last minute.

### Debate

On Wednesday, two days before the second round of voting closed, the Community team hosted a debate between Council Candidates during the weekly Atlas Brew event. Though some had hoped for many fireworks, it was mostly a very civil discussion between candidates. However, fireworks certainly started occurring in the votes after the debate had concluded!

The community team has set up a well-thought-out structure to ensure everyone had time to speak, which ensured everyone had no more to speak one minute at a time, and every candidate would at least get one question. Then, every candidate could ask for a talking slot to comment on that candidate’s answer.

You can find the [full recording on StarAtlasTV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_QL9JLj2Ng) and a [6.5-minute summary by Beth](https://x.com/bnBeth_solvax/status/1844664194265714895) on her X.

Star Atlas DAO Council #1 – Round 2 – Final Rank Standings

### Election Results

The Top 6 changed often after the debate had concluded, eventually resulting in Emperor just missing out. The final five are (in order of the algorithm picking them):

* **JP**
* **Funcracker**
* **King** **Bryan**
* **Bodhi**
* **DrumCarl05**

Their first official (virtual) meeting –including Dan (Legal Council)– will take place this coming Wednesday. A meeting with Glenn (Foundation Director) will take place the week after.

Meanwhile, the KYC process is underway (with the Foundation, meaning Glenn), and the five Council members are receiving Council Agreements they need to sign.

### STV Process

As the Single Transferrable Voting process is a good deal more complicated than the regular voting mechanic used so far in the other Polis Improvement Proposals, we created a [visualization tool](https://stv.aephia.com) that visualizes how the team’s algorithm goes through the steps for the first-ever STV Council PIPs. The two images above are screenshots made from this tool.

By pressing the _Next Step_\-button repeatedly, you are guided visually through the steps of the STV algorithm the team has been using. Clicking Finish will do this automatically for you every second until the process is done and the end result is visible.

Star Atlas – Golden Ticket

## Golden Carnival

The next SAGE Starbased update will bring us Golden Carnival! In anticipation of this pending release, the team has shared the recipe for creating Golden Tickets.

**_Note:_** It’s important to know that the old Golden Tickets can no longer be used for this Carnival. Only the new (2024) tickets will function.

**Golden Ticket (2024) Recipe:**

* Titanium: 230 required
* Toolkit: 137 required
* Framework: 103 required
* Electronics: 82 required
* Power Source: 69 required
* Electromagnet: 51 required
* Field Stabilizer: 34 required
* Radiation Absorber: 26 required
* Particle Accelerator: 21 required

No official ETA was shared, but it looks like the Carnival is starting very soon!

## Timeline

Last week, we [shared](https://aephia.com/star-atlas/weekly-star-atlas-newsletter-150/) the timeline for upcoming SAGE releases as part of Michael’s response to a community concern. For those who missed it (it was a long text), we include it here again so everyone is on the same page.

This is the order of upcoming releases that involve _economic_ SAGE functionality (meaning this completely disregards UE5 & Fleet Command):

1. Golden Tickets
2. Regional RFRs + Localized Markets
3. Fleet Rentals (possibly at the same time as #2)
4. Advanced financing options, like pay over time (this could take 6+ months after Fleet Rentals release)

## News bits

Two small bits of news that we figured are worth sharing:

* **Update Solflare**—A recent bug in a Solflare update caused transaction fees to be higher than normal. The Solflare team has fixed the issue, but please ensure that you have updated to the latest version of Solflare to avoid any further problems and continue paying standard fees.
* **Preseason Preview**—In case you missed it during the IMPACT Summit, the team has now published its[ Preseason development sneak peek ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?si=tt9EeZyLDwAuD1kZ&v=-r6kjpES1AM&feature=youtu.be)on the official Star Atlas YouTube account.

## Sneak peeks

[RenderDock Studios](https://renderdock.artstation.com/projects/0l44Y8) published some of their Calico adjustable crew seat renders on [Art Station](https://www.artstation.com/artwork/0l44Y8), and we are including a few of those shots below. They provided the following description:

> Designed as solution to Star Atlas ambitious task of accommodating characters of completely different sizes in the cockpit of a single spaceship. Can be used by characters from 1,2 m to 2,4 m tall and about 400 kg weight.
