This past week was a quiet one, and therefore, we will primarily look ahead a little at what is to come this week. Of course, the big ticket item is the imminent Crew Airdrop, but this week could also see the Council Elections kick off. The one thing that did happen this past week was the third episode of the Economic Forum took place, where the Econ team showed us a bunch of cool graphs and tables!

_Let’s just dive in!_

## Crew Airdrop Coming

This week, Star Atlas will pass a major milestone! Ever since the team sold its first ships in 2021 as part of its Galactic Asset Offering, the promise has been that one day, we would get the crew (and components) for those ships dropped!

This Friday, August 9th, roughly three years later, that will finally become a reality!

We discussed all this in our [previous issue](https://aephia.com/star-atlas/weekly-star-atlas-newsletter-140/), but we wanted to summarize the most important points here once more!

The team will take a snapshot of all ships on **August 8th** at _approximately_ **3 PM EST** / **19:00 UTC** / **21:00 CEST**. 

Only ships stored in **your wallet**, **Faction Fleet**, **SAGE** (Starbased), and the **Galactic Market** will be taken into account. If your ships reside elsewhere, they will **NOT** be included, and you will receive no airdrop of crew/components for that ship! Make sure to move your ships so they are all eligible!

On **August 9th**, at an unspecified moment in time, the team will airdrop all Crew to your profile’s inventory. You can then visit your inventory to claim them.

Please note that you will not be able to open the packs until next week, August 13th, when the official sale goes live!

Star Atlas – Crew is Coming!

## Crew Collabs

Over time, people have wondered why there seems to be such a disconnect between Star Atlas and the wider Solana ecosystem. Recently, we’ve seen one collaboration between [Honeyland](https://honey.land/) and Star Atlas through a Meta-crafting Recipe, but beyond that, nothing material happened these past few years.

The team took that feedback to heart and, as part of their promotional campaign, have been selecting several Solana/Web3 communities to partner with for their Crew Pack launch.

The gist of these collaborations seems to be that these projects can reward their members with free Crew Packs.

Given that marketing Crew Packs to a Web2 audience is probably not very helpful at this time (still), it makes sense to focus on Solana and the wider Web3 ecosystem instead.

The list of partners is still growing, but so far, these have been announced:

* Mad Lads
* Superteam
* Wilder World
* Oogy
* Good Game Hunters

Check out [this thread on X](https://x.com/staratlas/status/1818041870787969231) for a live list of projects the team is collaborating with!

## Economic Forum #3

This past Thursday, Chris and Gareth joined the Community team for their 3rd Star Atlas Economic Forum event.

The duo discussed many aspects of the economy, highlighted misconceptions within the community, and, of course, addressed the FTX selloff of ATLAS and POLIS tokens.

Econ Forum #3 – Starbased Daily Active Users

It was well worth watching for those interested in the Star Atlas economy and looking to gain a deeper understanding of it. Darwiin from the team [recorded](https://youtu.be/Et9Btd_RRvQ) the event (in addition to [StarAtlasTV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrRTywFCyK8)—who missed out on the first 5 minutes).

## Governance

Voting for [PIP-3](https://govern.staratlas.com/proposals/f5e7cde1-9a02-4670-ae40-1c932a4b8dad) and [PIP-4](https://govern.staratlas.com/proposals/ad1945d8-60dc-4ed7-b52a-63dd33f97415) is about to end in less than 24 hours after this issue’s publication. At the time of publication, [PIP-3: Star Atlas Council](https://govern.staratlas.com/proposals/f5e7cde1-9a02-4670-ae40-1c932a4b8dad) had 84.22% of voters vote in favor, with [PIP-4: Star Atlas Ecosystem Fund](https://govern.staratlas.com/proposals/ad1945d8-60dc-4ed7-b52a-63dd33f97415) sitting slightly below that, with 81.64% of the votes in favor. Voting on both PIPs ends on Tuesday, August 6th, at 16:00 UTC.

[PIP-5: Co-Sponsor the Naabathon](https://govern.staratlas.com/proposals/c248d280-15fb-4071-ba5d-2afaa6e1af41) will end three days later, on Friday, August 9th, at 16:00 UTC. A little over 76% of the votes have been in favor so far.

### Council Elections Nominations

Assuming PIP-3 gets approved, there will be two weeks during which Star Atlas community members can toss in their hats for a Council Member position, starting Wednesday, August 7th.

The deadline for this is August 20th, after which there will be another 2-week period where people can acquaint themselves with the nominees.

Voting will then start on September 4th and last one or two weeks, depending on the number of nominees. If there are 20 or fewer, then there will be two weeks of voting. If there are more, there will be two rounds instead, with each one lasting one week. As PIP-3 lines out, five council members will be elected from the nominees to serve on the first Council. 

_That’s it for this week! Thanks for reading!_
