Last week’s issue was chock-full of news shared during the first-ever Community Week. As expected, the week after was a very quiet one, with no new announcements or revelations from the team. We did learn a lot more about one of the Titan sales. On top of that, Michael (CEO) shared a thought he had with the community, triggering a multi-day discussion over multiple platforms. Oh, and a new Titan ship is now available for sale: _The Rainbow Phi_!

Let’s dive in!

SAGE: Starbased – Screenshot from early testing \[by the team\]

## SAGE: Starbased

It looks like testing has begun with a handful of community members. No real new information was shared, but during the Atlas Brew, the community shared a few tidbits and gave the first glimpse of what the UI may look like (see image above). 

Starbase maintenance plays a key role in Starbased. All Starbases have maintenance costs, no matter their tier. This means that the T1 Starbases out there need to be maintained if they are to function.

* **Food** – Without food, crafting will pause. Once food is provided again, crafting will continue.
* **Toolkits** – Without toolkits, the upgrade process will pause.

When combat is added in the future, Starbases will also require Ammo.

These costs will run up as the tier of the Starbase goes up. So, while at first glance it may make sense to upgrade Starbases as soon as possible, this will ramp up maintenance costs quite a bit and may lead to upgraded Starbases that are not working.

The CSS (the only Tier 6 Starbase) also needs maintenance. As it is a Tier 6 station, it is an insanely expensive endeavor. The faction players will need to pay for this, as that is the only location where the required component to upgrade other Starbases can be crafted (initially).

Another important aspect is that players will need to provide crew members if they want to contribute to the upgrade process. This means that, like with crafting now, these crew members will be locked into that process until your part is completed.

If the upgrade is completed before your task finishes, your contribution fails. You will receive a refund for the input materials and you will not receive any Loyalty Points for that part. This means that it would be good to communicate with others working on that upgrade to prevent this from happening.

## The First Titan Was Sold!

Last week, we saw a lot of buzz concerning the long-awaited sale of the first Titan ship, the **_Pearce T1_**! An important caveat at this point is that no money has exchanged hands at this time. The sale consisted of a handshake on the promise that money would be forthcoming.

The [_GG Collective_ ](https://ggcollective.gg/)revealed themselves as the buyers, with _[ForgedInCrypto](https://twitter.com/forgedincrypto)_ specifically having sealed the deal. They plan to sell GG tokens soon, allowing future owners to govern how the _Pearce T1_ will be deployed. Interestingly, in what is a bit of a throwback to how last bull cycle’s gaming guilds operated, it’s through this token sale that they plan to pay for the Titan ship.

ForgedInCrypto shared more details during the [last Metaverse Nomads show](https://www.youtube.com/live/tfFMrmFeb70?si=S2VPVmlCkvvV_lap), including that if the token sale does not go as they planned, he will step in and buy the ship himself. Of course, they hope enough people will jump aboard and buy themselves into this collective stewardship that this won’t be necessary.

### The Other Titans

This sale marks the first official Titan ship “sold,” but we expect to hear more about the _Fimbul ECOS Superphoenix_ soon as well, as that ship was taken off the market just days after the same happened to the T1.

This means that only one other Titan ship is currently available for sale on the marketplace, the _Busan Last Stand mk. VIII_. 

As a refresher, **the team plans to sell** **_21 Titan ships_** before handing over the crafting to the community (if indeed the community will be able to craft these).

There will be 3 Titan ships each for the following 7 factions:

* **MUD** (Pearce T1)
* **ONI** (Busan Last Stand mk. VIII)
* **Ustur** (VZUS &lt;unknown name&gt;)
* **ECOS** (Fimbul ECOS Superphoenix)
* **Jorvik** (Fimbul BYOS &lt;unknown name&gt;)
* **Tufa** (Tufa &lt;unknown name&gt;)
* **Photoli** (Rainbow Phi)

### Rainbow Phi Announced

On the verge of publishing this issue, the team added a brand new titan ship to their offering, the [Rainbow Phi](https://play.staratlas.com/market/phi4PYgmxeTMLLpGkU87T16VUZ6AjWZESkfT1JGJ635/)! This titan is now available on the marketplace for $5 million.

The flavor text for this, perhaps the _most exotic_ titan, is as follows:

> Rainbow Phi, embrace adventure into a metaphysical pilgrimage through the cosmic tapestry. This vessel’s domain is an alchemical crucible where the esoteric and empirical meld, catalyzing an elevation of the self. Within its sanctum, the mundane morphs into the mystical, inviting an omni-speculative voyage into the soul’s nebulous depths, guided by the stars. It’s a symposium of the sublime, a sunset and sunrise of the eyes, where the arcane secrets of the cosmos whisper to the attuned, offering enlightenment not just in the physical realm but in the ethereal expanse of consciousness. The poetic math of the universe is on display.

## Michael’s Late Night Musings

Last Friday night (US time), Michael dropped a controversial suggestion on the Star Atlas Discord. He noted that he was just brainstorming a bit and wanted to get the community’s opinion on an idea he had. All that to say, this has not gone through the proper internal ATMTA channels, and it’s not currently in the scope of becoming a reality. But, of course, it could be, depending on how it’s received and how the Econ & Game Design teams respond to it.

_In short, the idea is this:_ **Instead of burning ships on-chain in the HRZ when destroyed (in combat), GAO ships should be locked for 6-12 months before being returned.**

In other words, Michael suggested that GAO ships would be made indestructible, but when destroyed, their owners would not see that ship back for a long time. Now, he added right away that he could see people pay ATLAS to expedite seeing their ship returned to them, but there would be limits to that.

To clarify, GAO (_Galactic Asset Offering_) ships are those (originally) sold by the team or redeemed in SAGE. In short, they are all ships that currently exist and all ships that the team will sell in the future.

To clarify, _non-GAO_ ships will be ships crafted by players. These do not yet exist and will not for quite a while.

Michael came up with this -pretty dramatic- deviation \[from every ship being destructible\] because he is looking for ways to make the HRZ zone more active. Apparently, the team, or at least Michael, has grown increasingly concerned that the risk of losing one’s ship will keep the vast majority of players within the safer confines of the Secure Zone and the Medium Risk Zone.

### Community Sentiment

Based on the reactions on Discord, the community is split on this idea, though it looks like there is a narrow majority in favor of this change. This means there is still a lot of pushback as well, which is interesting because this move clearly benefits current ship owners.

In that sense, it is encouraging to see that the community is not just looking at their own bags but also at the long-term consequences of such changes to the game. The discussion will no doubt continue, and it’s great to see the community being invited so early into big-impact decisions such as these!

_That is it for this issue. Thanks for reading & until next week!_
