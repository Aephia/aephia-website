_Welcome to our 47th newsletter on Star Atlas! This is a weekly newsletter, published by Aephia Industries, that is focused entirely on Star Atlas. Here we try to aggregate all the newsworthy tidbits that were dropped by the team throughout the past week._

---

This week's newsletter is a little on the short side, as the news has all but dried up in anticipation of the upcoming 426Live:NYK event. The team has been in crunch mode for the past week to get everything ready for the grand reveal!

Of course, we did get a new [Roadmap Scan (issue 21)](https://medium.com/star-atlas/the-council-of-peace-academy-mission-showroom-star-atlas-roadmap-scan-21-36f38988861)! Like with the previous 426Live event, the story of Wenn & co has been put temporarily on hold, to kick off a new journey that provides some color to the upcoming 426Live event, in particular to the showroom!

## 426Live:NYK

The topic on both the team's and community's mind right now is the 426Live event that will be taking place this Thursday. Not much new information has come out since the original announcement, but something that deserves to be repeated is that this upcoming event will take place on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/StarAtlasGame), instead of Discord.

There will also be, like last time, a special *Brew* session afterwards, which will be hosted on Discord. And for the press, there is going to be a private session hosted on Zoom right after the main event concludes (this was on Discord last time as well).

**Event details**
- When: Thursday September 29th @ 17:00 UTC / 1PM EDT / 19:00 CET
- Where: [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/StarAtlasGame)

## Progress

The team did not have that much to report regarding their progress last week, so we gathered it into a single section:
## SCREAM

The past week Game Design has been working together with the Economics team on looting mechanics. The two have been refining the levers and mechanics of loot drops. Besides this, the Econimics team also defined all ATLAS sinks that are going to be present in SCREAM.

The Blockchain team has continued work on the Sector Program. Finally, the UX department has been adding fidelity to the *Outliner*, such as filtering and column sorting. Additionally they have been busy on visualizing high system density using the heads-up display.
## Other

Besides SCREAM, here is an overview of the other progress reported:
- The Showroom team has been busy finalizing their distribution preparations.
- The DAO team has been working on implementing analytics and will focus on the DAO Proposal (Flow) next.
- The Graphic Novel team has been working on the UI for comic readers.
- The Marketplace team is busy rolling out several bug fixes and improvements, including: sorting by rarity, removal of the *fixed* "1" in the input field, and removing "stuck" orders.
- The Marketplace Fees as nearly done, some work remains regarding the team's internal services that are interacting with the Solana chain.

## AI Art Contest

We've seen the team use AI-created art in their last few Roadmap Scan reports, and now they have called upon the community to create more of such art inspired by Star Atlas and Space / Sci-fi in general.

In order to have a chance at winning a *Star Atlas Explorer Kit*, you will have to:
1. Create & tweet AI-generated pics of **environments/planets** in Star Atlas you’re most excited to see/visit
2. Follow & tag [@StarAtlas](https://twitter.com/staratlas)
3. Add [#WeAreStarAtlas](https://twitter.com/hashtag/WeAreStarAtlas?src=hashtag_click) & the tool used (Midjourney, Stable Diffusion or DALL-E)

You can enter as many times as you like!

This is the first time the team ever mentioned a "Star Atlas Explorer Kit", which includes a Merch Kit, Fimbul Lowbies, Airbikes & more. 

The submission deadline is Tuesday, September 27, at 12 pm (EDT) and there will be a special Twitter Spaces hosted on Wednesday, September 28 where the team will go over the results and pick the winner!
