Asked, whether ships will be faction-agnostic(not limited to a single faction), Bunthius, CPO of the Star Atlas, told members of the exclusive Foundation Channel on the Star Atlas Discord: “Yes, primarily it’s just for expanded universe lore info. But when manufacturing new ships, the blueprints rewarded will likely be tied to the faction region the player is leveling up their ship manufacturing license. But that will come much later when full ship crafting comes online.”
