Going into the Galactic Asset Offering of 2022 the Star Atlas marketplace will see a shift towards ATLAS, the in-game currency: “The payment model for new ships is moving towards a majority utilization of the Star Atlas in-game currency, [ATLAS](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/star-atlas/). The availability of each new ship’s supply will be in an **80–20 ratio** of ATLAS and UDSC, 80% of the total quantity being set for purchase exclusively with ATLAS and the remaining 20% with USDC.”

This was [announced](https://medium.com/star-atlas/2022-inaugural-spaceship-nft-drop-golden-age-of-space-exploration-759328e6949) today by the Star Atlas team. There will be a total of 51 new ships coming to the market, of which three will be gigantic awe-inspiring Titan class ships that will be sold via a fair auction system later this year.
