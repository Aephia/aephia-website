_Welcome to our 59th newsletter on Star Atlas! This weekly newsletter is published by Aephia Industries and focuses entirely on Star Atlas. Here we try to aggregate all the newsworthy tidbits that were dropped by the team throughout the past week._

Last Friday, the team organized a big [event](https://youtube.com/watch?v=5pgZFtwogCI) that included the launch of the Showroom Pre-release 2, a short Townhall meeting ([recap](https://aephia.com/star-atlas/townhall-recap-december-16th-2002/)), and the conclusion of the Joni Awards!

A lot of content came with that, including updates to the Start Sequence, SAGE Game Manual, and a surprise drop of ship skins! Let's dive right in!

## Volant Studio Showroom - Pre-Season R2

Last Friday, the team released the second release of the pre-season version of the Showroom! It includes many anticipated features, such as:
- Character & Skin selection
- Flying ships (only: Pearce X4, Calico Medtech & Floyd Liner)
- Racing (2 tracks)
- Dogfighting in space (player-vs-environment)
- Multiplayer (up to 32 players)
- A larger map
- More ships (in various states)

With regards to the multiplayer, Michael (CEO) cautioned during the Townhall that there are some known bugs that the team still has to address. However, the decision was made to open it up regardless while they are attempting to patch it.

The team released an [extensive article](https://medium.com/star-atlas/lift-off-star-atlas-launches-pre-season-with-an-all-new-version-of-showroom-5d5c219d598c) covering all the new features and how to get started with playing this UE5 experience, which is definitely worth a read!
## The next release: 2.1

During the Townhall, Michael also shared what we can expect in the next 2.1 patch. It will include the following:
- Upgrade to Unreal Engine 5.1 (allows for larger maps)
- A working train - This will function as a lobby of sorts. Upon your first arrival in the Showroom, you will start at the Train station.
- Group Chat & Proximity Voice Chat

It might also include a special ground racing mode, though that is not sure yet.
## Flight Instruction Video

The team has also recorded a small video to help players along with flying their ships around in R2:

## Start Sequence - Phase 2

Phase 2 of the Golden Era: Start Sequence is kicking off this Tuesday at 17:00 UTC! The team has even assigned a unique name to this stage: **Cosmic Overture**. A new article and an updated version of the original PDF brochure were released to prepare everyone for this event.

Check the image below for a summary of the most important properties of the Claim Stakes:

## SAGE

One of the highlights of last week was undoubtedly the [release](https://medium.com/star-atlas/star-atlas-golden-era-game-manual-vol-ii-the-game-structure-c931a2c933a0) of the first draft of the (Second Volume of the) [Game Manual for SAGE](https://staratlas.com/newsroom/game-manuals/sage-game-manual-part-2-game-structure) (the first Volume being the Economic Manual released recently). Not only does it contain everything you need to grasp what the gameplay will look like, but it also contains a section on how Ships will differ from one model to the next and an appendix that sheds more light on the Claim Stakes that will go on sale this Tuesday.

In other news, during the Townhall, Michael mentioned that the devnet release of SAGE would not happen before February 2023. Not all the V0 features will likely be in there (the same is stated in the manual).

## SCORE - Surprise X4 Skin Drop

To celebrate the first anniversary of SCORE (aka Faction Fleet) and to thank the community, the team airdropped exclusive skins to everyone who had ships enlisted for over a week. Depending on the max enlistment duration on your account, you would have received different (and potentially various) skins:
- 7+ days enlisted: Suntiger Pearce X4 Skin
- 150+ days enlisted: RedX-IV Pearce X4 Skin
- 300+ days enlisted: Blue Tigu Pearce X4 Skin

For example, if you have been enlisting a single fleet for over 300 days, you should have received all three skins by now!
