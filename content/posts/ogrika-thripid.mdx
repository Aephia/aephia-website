The Ogrika Thripid is a legendary large fighter ship NFT in the Star Atlas metaverse. In this guide, our Star Atlas veterans will give you an overview of the role of this ship, module configuration options and component configuration possibilities. We will talk about fleet and travel considerations before we take our look at buffs via charms and skins and complete our guide with the crew member considerations.

See how the Ogrika Thripid is doing on the Marketplace on our [Ship Market Overview](https://aephia.com/star-atlas-ships/).

The Ogrika Thripid is a testment to glorious super luxury Punaab culture while demonstrating powerful and brutal strength. This large and heavy fighter also has a powerful rudder thruster for unusually quick maneuverability for a ship this size. The massive forward facing cannons are positioned to obliterate any enemy on the business end of the Thripid. On top of being an arsenal powerhouse, the interior provides a very comfortable and equally luxury accomodations. The Captain of a ship of this magnitude can utilize the weaponry to establish a very safe escort environment while enjoying the lush amenities for long distance space travel with a huge boost to peace of mind.

### Manufactured by Ogrika

![ogrika star atlas manufacturer 02](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/3ae869fe0df20b6e7b801fb0bf1afb1acec48fb4e738aeeb0477ad0bd3bcf47a.jpg "ogrika star atlas manufacturer 02")
Ogrika is one of the ship manufacturers that have aligned with not only one but two of the major factions. A major alignment with the ONI and a minor alignment with the Ustur in the case of Ogrika. Their blueprints and designs are therefore a mix of civilian, stealth, and military technologies.

An Ogrika ship will let you experience “astronomical opulence” only attainable through the inimitable signature of the viciously wealthy punaab ship manufacturers. Busan ships are made mainly of the resources that can be found in higher abundance in the ONI and Ustur faction spaces.

If you ever want to build an Ogrika ship yourself, you will need the respective blueprint. How to get one? You will need to get in a manufacturer’s good graces. To get there, you will have to prove that both your interests are aligned and/or that you’re supporting them. In in-game terms, you will need to gain loyalty (aka reputation) with them, before they judge you worthy of building ships with their logo on them (accruing loyalty won’t be possible before the SCORE v1 and CREAM v1 modules have been released).

Gaining loyalty with Ogrika requires completing their missions. To gain access to these missions, you will either have to be a member of the Ustur or ONI faction or you will need a faction passport. These passes function a little like real-world visas, allowing you to visit another faction’s territory and trade with them. More importantly, in this case, a faction pass will allow you to accept and complete missions for the manufacturers that are aligned to that faction.

Be aware that by being part of the ONI faction you will gain loyalty quicker with the Ogrika manufacturer since they have their major alignment with that faction. It will take you more time as an Ustur to unlock Ogrika blueprints.

You can learn more about shipbuilding and blueprints in our [in-depth guide](https://aephia.com/star-atlas/star-atlas-shipbuilding-blueprints-loyalty/).

### A fully equipped Generation 1 model

![star atlas ship ogrika thripid 03](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/41c34ff457f501d3e9303e234fd505a44a9cff672566312b23108099684d59c7.jpg "star atlas ship ogrika thripid 03")

Remember that all ships bought through the GAO ([Galactic Asset Offering](https://staratlaswiki.org/wiki/GAO)), are delivered fully loaded. In later game stages, new ships will be barebone and only limited components are bespoke and fixed. So – you’re not only getting a Generation 1 model, but you’re also getting more bang for your buck!

However, the ships will still fully customizable. All the various modules can be changed/sold as needed as confirmed by Bunthius (Star Atlas CPO): “_The plan right now is that all GAO ships come with filled crew/component/module slots. You’ll be able to un-slot all these GAO filler items and sell them, and respec individually._”

### Earning potential of the Ogrika Thripid

![star atlas ship ogrika thripid 01](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/8eccf0db1367f085545d01f1b3a39316406c1c513e59081557a79019d22d5c06.jpg "star atlas ship ogrika thripid 01")

If you’re wondering how much you can earn with your Ogrika Thripid in Star Atlas, here are some facts:

Before Star Atlas releases the full game in the Unreal 5 engine, all players have the opportunity to participate in the browser game (called SCORE) with their ship NFTs to generate revenue (learn all the details about the [Star Atlas mini game](https://aephia.com/star-atlas/what-is-the-star-atlas-mini-game-score/) in our guide).

If the player provides his ship to his faction (ONI, MUD or Ustur), he will receive ATLAS, the in-game currency of Star Atlas, in return. This amount is measured by the **VWAP** (the “volume weighted average price” at which the ship was offered in the Galactic Asset Offering) of your ships. For the Ogrika Thripid, the VWAP is **$8,506** USDC.

So if you have the opportunity to buy this ship at a price below the VWAP, this could be a good deal for you (of course no financial or ship advice).
