_Welcome to our 60th newsletter on Star Atlas! This weekly newsletter is published by Aephia Industries and focuses entirely on Star Atlas. Here we try to aggregate all the newsworthy tidbits that were dropped by the team throughout the past week._

Due to Christmas celebrations on our side, this newsletter finds you one day later than usual. It will be a short but special one, as this is the last newsletter we're sending out in 2022!

The ATMTA team is currently enjoying their holiday break, which started December 21st and will last until January 3rd. As a result, there is not that much news this week. However, one big item that remains is the land sale that kicked off on December 20th.

## Start Sequence - Phase 2

The discounted ship sales ended, and [phase 2](https://medium.com/star-atlas/cosmic-overture-begins-land-and-claim-stakes-up-for-grabs-in-phase-2-of-sage-start-sequence-f47fa9f2f6c3) of the Start Sequence, also dubbed *Cosmic Overture*, officially started on December 20th.

There are two categories of assets being sold during this sales window. Both of these have not been sold before:
1. Claim Stakes (5 different tiers)
2. Land Plots on Central Space Stations (6 tiers for each of the three different factions)

During the first 24 hours, the team managed to sell over 1 $million worth of these land-based assets! However, sales did significantly slow down afterward.

These sales will end officially on January 31st, or when the supply runs out. For more information on all the specifics, see our [previous newsletter](https://intel.aephia.com/newsletters/weekly-star-atlas-newsletter-59/).

## Claim Stake - Sale

People that buy Claim Stakes **directly from the team** (meaning: from the official Star Atlas account on the Galactic Marketplace) during this special sale period (December 20 - January 31) will receive an exclusive bonus airdrop of a Mining Drill and Power Plant of the **exact same tier** as the acquired claim stake.

Put differently: *You will not get an airdrop if you buy a Claim Stake from another player.*

This airdrop will come *after* the sale ends on January 31st.

Contrary to the ship sales, there are no hard discounts here, though the team has stated that these sales represent a rare opportunity.
## Buildings

At this point in time, the team does not expect to sell:
- Mining Drills
- Power Plants

*It seems likely that Space Stations should also be on that list, but so far, the team has not yet confirmed this.*

Besides the current supply & upcoming airdrops, the only source of these constructions will be the players themselves.

In anticipation of that, the team opened the secondary markets for the three aforementioned constructions this past weekend. **All of the constructions on offer there are Tier 1 versions**. These have been airdropped previously as part of the Rebirth meta-poster series' rewards.

To get an idea of the prices for the Mining Drill and Power Plant, note that a Claim Stake - Tier 1 costs 32 USDC and will come with an (airdropped) Tier 1 Mining  Drill and Power Plant.

## CSS Land Plots

Besides the Claim Stakes, roughly 10% of the available land/habitats on the three Central Space Stations has also been made available for sale.

There are 6 different tiers of land/habs for each of the three factions, meaning there are **18 different** items on the Galactic Marketplace.

Note that all items currently depict ONI space station (specifically even the Sogmian district) imagery due to these being the only designs available. In the future, these will be updated to reflect the correct location.

There are 4 discount tranches for each of the 18 variants. The first batch to go on sale came at the highest discount of 15%. Once the supply runs out, the next batch goes on sale, but at a 5% lower discount. The result is each variant comes with 4 batches, being sold at a 15%, 10%, 5%, and 0% discount (for the last batch).

## Editor's Note

We hope you all enjoyed a merry Christmas and wish you all the best for 2023, with a lot of Star Atlas goodness!

This is also one of the last newsletter issues you are receiving (or reading) through the Revue platform, as Elon Musk has decided to wind this service down (Twitter acquired it in early 2021). Worry not, though! We'll make sure our newsletter will find you in 2023, regardless!

Due to the team enjoying their holiday break, unfortunately, there won't be a newsletter next week. **We'll be back with the latest Star Atlas news on January 9th!**
