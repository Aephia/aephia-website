Danny Floyd, Star Atlas CPO, gave a brief glimpse into the future of ship missions that will be introduced in future iterations of SCORE:

“First off your crew can be a mix of NPC and PCs. But we’re also planning some story missions that are playable for all, the infinite replayable ones result in XP. The season/chapter style limited ones that give items will be quantity limited and within econ-approved drop rates so as not to inflate the economy. Those will be story missions with story characters, not just your own crew NPCs.”
