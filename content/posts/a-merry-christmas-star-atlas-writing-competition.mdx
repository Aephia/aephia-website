**Interstellar Communication, Year 2623 of the MUD Calendar — The Cradle**

Today marks the centennial of a pivotal moment in galactic history: the signing of the Treaty of Peace by Bekalu, Armi.eldr, and Charon Gotti, ending the catastrophic Convergence War. As a firsthand witness to this historic event, I reflect on the profound realization that emerged that day — the understanding that war among us would inevitably lead to the collapse of civilization, plunging Galia into millennia of darkness.

A century has passed, and I stand before you, gratified to affirm that we have successfully averted this dire fate. Through our collective sacrifices, unwavering commitment, and tireless efforts, we have forged a robust galactic federation. This federation stands as a bulwark of freedom, prosperity, equality, and peace, safeguarding the rights and well-being of every citizen.

Our unified galactic economy, free from biases and regional disparities, empowers members of all species to traverse the Starpath, engaging in lawful commerce throughout Galia’s civilized reaches. The results are tangible: life expectancy has soared within the safe zones, and under our vigilant governance, no citizen in our worlds suffers from criminality, poverty, or hunger.

As we honor our founding trio — Bekalu, Armi.eldr, and Charon Gotti — I believe their spirits rejoice in the legacy they bestowed upon their descendants.

Today, we stand at the cusp of a new chapter, looking beyond our home systems. The inhabitants of the Medium Zone, our galactic kin, aspire to integrate into our thriving ecosystem. We eagerly anticipate their inclusion, despite the challenges posed by a faction thriving on chaos in their realm.

We’ve witnessed and countered dark forces in the Medium Zone, such as the dismantling of the Slave Cartel in Frenir and the repulsion of the Jorvik Pirate fleet. These victories exemplify our commitment to extending our values of freedom and justice beyond our borders.

Yet, we recognize and respect the desire for political autonomy within the Medium Zone. The Council honors their wish for sovereignty, provided it aligns with our collective goal of a unified and peaceful Galia.

In this spirit, as the Ruling Secretary of the Council of Peace, I am proud to announce a significant shift in our approach to the Medium Zone. Effective immediately, the Council of Peace will cease all military operations there. Instead, we will focus on fostering peaceful trade and social inclusion. In the coming weeks, we will initiate the registration of civilian corporations eager to develop commercial ties and enhance the existing intergalactic commerce infrastructure in the Medium Zone.

This announcement is not merely a policy shift — it is a milestone in Galia’s journey towards everlasting peace, paralleling the significance of the Treaty of Peace itself.

Let us celebrate our peace, together.

_Vaor Scarka — Ruling Secretary of the Council of Peace_

## 100 Years of Peace

Star Atlas – Signing of the Peace Treaty \[Rebirth Collection\]

This year, 2623, marks the 100th anniversary of the Signing of the [Treaty of Peace](https://lore.staratlas.com/governments-and-groups/the-federation/treaty-of-peace). After the devastating Convergence War, the leaders of the remnants of the major factions involved came together to sign a treaty that would finally bring an end to their conflict. An important part of that treaty was establishing a new body whose primary goal was to ensure a lasting peace between the factions. This body was, therefore, aptly named the **Council of Peace** (COP).

With unrest stirring again and deadly battles occurring in various parts of our shared galaxy, it is all the more important to look beyond the things that make us different. Instead, we should take a moment to appreciate the things we share in our lives, things that bring us together. We would find that we have much more in common than there are things differentiating us.

This year marks a major milestone! A feat worth worthy of celebration! We have been at peace for the last 100 years! Something none of us would have thought of way back when the war broke out. The 100th anniversary of the Treaty of Peace, and with it of the Council of Peace, is a strong reminder that we have it in us to set aside our differences and embrace that which unites us! We have been at peace for 100 standard galactic years, and if you all will it, we can add another 100 with ease.

No matter if you are a citizen of the MUD Territory, ONI Region, or Ustur Sector, no doubt you are able to recount at least one wonderful story of great things happening that would not have been possible without this time of peace. This holiday season, in the spirit of peace and in order to properly commemorate this centennial, we are inviting all of you to put that story into writing and share it with the whole Galia Expanse!

## Lore Writing Competition

In the spirit of MUD/ECOS celebrations of the past, such as Thanksgiving, Yule, and Christmas, we are organizing, in collaboration with ATMA, a short story writing competition that is focused on peace. The year 2023 (2623 in the parallel universe Star Atlas universe) is soon coming to a close, and before that happens, we think it is important to celebrate this special in-fiction event.

**_Your mission, should you choose to accept:_**

Write a small, feel/good, peace-inspiring story about members of different COP factions living, working, and/or being brought together in peace. We want to see stories that could be turned into a movie script for an intergalactic Christmas-feely movie. You know.. the feel-good story, the tearjerker, the happy endings (no, not those kinds!).

If you are interested, read on for the specifics!

## Competition Details

Write a short story featuring individuals (or groups) from two or three of the COP factions (MUD, ONI, Ustur).

Your story must:

* be between 800-1200 words and in English
* be a celebration of, or an anecdote made possible only due to, the peaceful coexistence of the COP factions within the Galia Expanse
* be submitted by December 24th at 23:59 UTC
* not be written by AI tools (we are using tools to check)

Additionally, there is a limit of **max** **two stories per person.**

We encourage you to peruse the [Lore Wiki](https://lore.staratlas.com) to get a good understanding of the different factions and their individual and collective history. Let this be a source of inspiration!

## Submission

Submitting your story can be done by publishing it online and then linking it in a new post on our [Aephia Discord](https://discord.gg/aephia), specifically in the **_🏆100-years-cop-entries_**\-channel. Alternatively, if it fits, you can paste the story into a Discord post there immediately.

_\[When entering the [Aephia Discord](https://discord.gg/aephia), please choose “Interested in SA” and proceed to verify your account. Afterward, you will have immediate access to the competition channel.\]_

If it does not fit, you will have to use a (free) service online to store your story. You may know of an online service that allows you to publish text online, and you are welcome to use any service you feel is adequate. However, such services must not require any form of authentication to access. Clicking the link should result in immediate access to your story.

If you do not know of such services, we recommend using Medium. We’ve used it for similar competitions in the past. You can write posts there for free.

## Winner(s) Selection

As we have done in the past, the winners are determined over two rounds of judging and voting.

First, the community will be asked to vote on all stories by adding a ❤️ reaction to any stories that inspired them.

Next up, the final judges, all members of the Star Atlas core team (ATMTA), will read and rate the 16 stories that received the most community votes.

We are very grateful to Jose and his team for donating some of their time to this endeavor! As the team is very busy, please understand that they do not have the time to review every submission. We hope you can all agree that they have more important things to do.

Now, we know from experience that community voting is not ideal, as this always invites favoritism and collusion. However, there is no better way of weeding out the good from the sublime. We need a way to trim down the selection of stories for the judges, and we have not found a better alternative yet.

## ChatGPT & Other AI Help

Nowadays, you can let bots write a whole story for you. Though we can’t detect such stories with 100% accuracy, letting AI write a story for you is not in the spirit of this competition. We want to read what human story writers can come up with. We want to see and reward human creativity and ingenuity.

To that end, for this competition, we expressly **forbid using AI tools** to write the majority of your story. Of course, you can still:

* use tools such as Grammarly to fix mistakes and improve individual sentences
* use AI tools to help you come up with / continue /wrap up a storyline
* use AI tools to improve the readability of your story  
Concerning this last point, be careful when asking AI to improve your story. If you copy/paste everything they suggest, your story may be flagged as being written by AI and subsequently disqualified. The gist is that you can use AI to inspire _and correct you, but make sure to use your own words_.

## Languages

We recognize that non-English speakers are at a clear disadvantage here. This is unfortunate, but also the reality of the present. As our judges only share a proficiency in the English language, we can not accept stories written in other languages.

Note that you are, of course, able to write a story in your own language and use a translation tool to convert it to English. Be aware, though, that such translations, unfortunately, also often introduce mistakes, producing rough reads.

AI tools may help to smoothen out such rough results, but be careful not to let it rewrite your whole story while it does so (see the section above).

## Timeline

Below is an easy overview of the timeline for this competition:

* **November 29th** – Kick-off
* **December 24th** – Deadline for submission (23:59 UTC)
* **January 8th** – Handoff of the top (TBD) stories to ATMTA
* TBD (target: end of January) – Conclusion – Winners will be announced

## Prizes

A competition is always better when prizes are involved, and we are grateful to ATMTA for sponsoring some of these!

We are also chipping in from our end by giving away **4** [**ALF NFT**s](https://aeplife.io)

We are still in the stage of locking down the exact prizes and will update this article when we have these finalized!

### First Place

* 2x ALF NFT
* 2x Fimbul Lowbie

### Second Place

* 1x ALF NFT
* 1x Fimbul Lowbie

### Third Place

* 1x ALF NFT
* 1x Fimbul ECOS Unibomba

## In Closing

We hope this competition will inspire you to get your creative juices flowing! If not, we at least hope you will enjoy reading the fan fiction others wrote. We felt that this momentous in-fiction milestone deserves its time in the spotlight, and we believe the theme nicely synergizes with the Christmas period.

**_Good luck putting your story on paper!_**
