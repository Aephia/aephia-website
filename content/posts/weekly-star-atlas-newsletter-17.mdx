## Roadmap

The roadmap has been updated with details regarding asset distribution on Opensea as well as showroom information. Visit and bookmark [Star Atlas: Official Roadmap](https://staratlas.notion.site/staratlas/72cb710bbd894cd8819bde948e42ac31?v=e04635a9f986479ba7db0ac67ba2b3df) and [Star Atlas Roadmap Report](https://staratlas.notion.site/Roadmap-Report-8e75d87c5b7b4a67afb4fd776d6c3176) to stay informed about the latest news. 

Roadmap update as of February 25:

Opensea
- Wrapping up distribution of GAO Assets. If you haven’t reached out, please contact Star Atlas support.

Showroom
- Upgrade UE5 version to Preview currently underway containing significant performance boosts to lumen and nanite.
- Continued progress on the interior and exterior of the Showroom module. New foliage and other natural elements added to the asset library.
- Teams aligning for multiplayer & social feature enhancements in the Showroom module.

## Assets

Two news ships have been officially launched. These are the Ogrika Mik and the Fimbul ECOS Unibomba. Visit the Star Atlas Marketplace to get your hands on these.

An interesting thing to note on the Unibomba, is that it only carries a single (terraforming) bomb. It will need to return to a shipyard, or other ECOS ship (Bombarella or larger) to re-arm.

## Development

Michael confirmed that they have selected [Tribeca DAO](https://tribeca.so/), an already established DAO framework on the Solana chain, to aid them in the governance component. Using this existing solution allows their team to ease up on development efforts. However, custom development is still necessary since such tools do not offer all-in-one and out-of-the box solutions that satisfy their needs and requirements.
