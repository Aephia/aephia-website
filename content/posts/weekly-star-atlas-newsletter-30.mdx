## Retreat

The past week, key members of the team have met in the flesh during the first-ever company retreat. For many of them, this marked the first time they met each other face-2-face!

It's also the reason why there is almost no news to report on this week.

## Announcements

Star Atlas just launched its Web3 Security Framework Initiative in partnership with [Kudelski Security](https://kudelskisecurity.com/) at the World Economic Forum (WEF) 2022. The team sent [two of its members](https://twitter.com/staratlas/status/1529539557196279808) to Davos, Switzerland to attend the WEF, held from May 22-26. Kudelski Security is the world leader in digital security and the leading provider of security solutions for large blockchain-based applications, exchanges, and ecosystems. This partnership covers audits and analysis to help ensure the integrity of the Star Atlas metaverse is maintained. Kudelski Security will reinforce the security of the Star Atlas metaverse by testing protocols and looking for potential vulnerabilities that can be resolved.

## Progress

Due to the retreat, the team did not report on last week's progress.

## Ships

The team is planning to release a new ship this week. The [teaser](https://twitter.com/staratlas/status/1529506612737712129?s=20&t=x2Un3sjoRwB-iRfEqxBJ0Q) [images](https://twitter.com/staratlas/status/1529880097989304321) [released](https://twitter.com/staratlas/status/1530927491304640512?s=20&t=x2Un3sjoRwB-iRfEqxBJ0Q) so far suggest this to be an Ogrika ship, most likely the Ogrika Tursic (medium fighter).

## Teaser Video

The team released a short teaser video that looks to be showing an advanced radar at work within Unreal Engine 5. Check it out [here](https://twitter.com/staratlas/status/1529254497897283584?s=20&t=x2Un3sjoRwB-iRfEqxBJ0Q).
