We finally have some news with regards to commander ships availability from the CEO himself. In response to a question on whether commander ships will be available before the mini-game, Michael Wagner replied that they will be available “_probably slightly_ _before_“. So, it looks like players will be able to buy commander ships round about the time when the mini-game launches.
