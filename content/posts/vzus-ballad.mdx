VZUS ballad commands strength and beholds the beauty of flawless engineering. The ballad serves as a pocket carrier for surprisingly brutal defensive tactics utilizing a number of small and medium ships on deck. This vessel serves as a home for large crew sets performing the majority of in demand operations in battle or simply exploring deep space. No well-rounded VZUS fleet is complete without one or two of these ships in formation. Captaining a VZUS ballad capital fighter class starship is suited for the best of the best.

### Manufactured by VZUS

VZUS is one of the 3 ship manufacturers that have firmly aligned themselves with a single major faction – in this case the USTUR. Their blueprints and designs are focused on mixture of military and stealth technology.

VZUS ships are made mainly of the resources that can be found in higher abundance in the USTUR faction space (Viscovite, Dodiline, Lithium). These materials translate into highly nimble thruster tech and top tier hull reinforcing pipelines.

If you ever want to build a VZUS ship yourself, you will need the according blueprint. How to get one? You will need to get in a manufacturer’s good graces. To get there, you will have to prove that both your interests are aligned and/or that you’re supporting them. In in-game terms, you will need to gain loyalty (aka reputation) with them, before they judge you worthy of building ships with their logo on them (accruing loyalty won’t be possible before the SCORE v1 and CREAM v1 modules have been released).

Gaining loyalty with VZUS requires completing their missions. To gain access to these missions, you will either have to be a member of the USTUR faction or you will need a faction passport. These passes function a little like real-world visas, allowing you to visit another factions’ territory and trade with them. More importantly, in this case, a faction pass will allow you to accept and complete missions for the manufacturers that are aligned to that faction. You can learn more about shipbuilding and blueprints in our [in-depth guide](https://aephia.com/star-atlas/star-atlas-shipbuilding-blueprints-loyalty/).

### A fully equipped Generation 2 model

Remember that all ships bought through the GAO ([Galactic Asset Offering](https://staratlaswiki.org/wiki/GAO)), are delivered fully loaded. In later game stages, new ships will be barebone and only limited components are bespoke and fixed. So – you’re not only getting a Generation 2 model, but you’re also getting more bang for your buck!

However, the ships will still be fully customizable. All the various modules can be changed/sold as needed as confirmed by Bunthius (Star Atlas CPO): “_The plan right now is that all GAO ships come with filled crew/component/module slots. You’ll be able to un-slot all these GAO filler items and sell them, and respec individually._”

### Earning potential of the VZUS ballad

If you’re wondering how much you can earn with your VZUS ballad in Star Atlas, here are some facts:

Before Star Atlas releases the full game in the Unreal 5 engine, all players have the opportunity to participate in the browser game (called SCORE) with their ship NFTs to generate revenue (learn all the details about the [Star Atlas mini game](https://aephia.com/star-atlas/what-is-the-star-atlas-mini-game-score/) in our guide).

If the player provides his ship to his faction (ONI, MUD or Ustur), he will receive ATLAS, the in-game currency of Star Atlas, in return. This amount is measured by the **VWAP** (the “volume weighted average price” at which the ship was offered in the Galactic Asset Offering) of your ships. For the VZUS ballad, the VWAP is **$33,286** USDC.

So if you have the opportunity to buy this ship at a price below the VWAP, this could be a good deal for you (of course no financial or ship advice).
