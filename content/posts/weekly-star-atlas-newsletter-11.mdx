## News

After months of waiting and 4-6 week delays, SCORE was formally launched last Thursday, December 16. Individuals who had ships in their wallets received a full supply of resources for all their ships via an airdrop. The snapshot for this airdrop was announced in the official Star Atlas Discord and was taken a day before launch. Though “airdropped”, ship-owners did have to visit their inventory to claim them, which came with some (for most) unexpected high fees. 

As of writing, over $72 million worth of ships has been enlisted in SCORE, spread over more than 53,000 fleets.

## Gameplay

In case you missed it, we published [Star Atlas: SCORE — The Complete Guide](https://medium.com/aephia-industries/star-atlas-score-the-complete-guide-ff117f749058). This in-depth article explains what SCORE is and how it works. It aims to guide prospective and current players on how to optimize buying and spending resources and how to make the most efficient decisions. In addition to this guide, we also compiled a [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Gft0fYAW8HF7YvTSz2c7mdolRFIA8VM0RA6UrgosgBg/edit#gid=0) that you can check out if you are looking for the earnings and costs of each of the ships.

## Star Atlas Team

The team is aware of some known issues, specifically, with the withdrawal of ships.

Though Michael mentioned they are taking a two weeks off -they will be back January 3rd, a skeleton crew is still present to make sure everything remains going smoothly.

We wish all of you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!
