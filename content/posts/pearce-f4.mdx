The Pearce F4 is a rare medium fighter ship NFT in the Star Atlas metaverse. In this guide, our Star Atlas veterans will give you an overview of the role of this ship, module configuration options and component configuration possibilities. We will talk about fleet and travel considerations before we take our look at buffs via charms and skins and complete our guide with the crew member considerations.

See how the Pearce F4 is doing on the Marketplace on our [Ship Market Overview](https://aephia.com/star-atlas-ships/).

Standard issue Council of Peace medium sized patrol vessel made available to the private sector. The Pearce F4 has oversized weapon hardpoints and missile bay to punch above its weight class. Throw in that extra bit of fuel storage for those deep space patrols. The F4 is a workhorse, a patrol vessel, an escort and has a nice sized cargo hold to do a little freight on the side. It’s a well rounded ship with all the amenities to house a crew of four to five members for most of your difficult missions.

### Manufactured by Pearce

![pearce manufacturer star atlas 1](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/925b76b4f06c27bee0d9d6baf9ae2f431782b2b19083fc3537112928ea81c04f.jpg "pearce manufacturer star atlas 1")

Pearce is one of the 3 ship manufacturers that have firmly aligned themselves with a single major faction – in this case the MUD. Their blueprints and designs are heavily focused on military technology. Fitting, given the fact that one of the faction traits of the MUD is “firepower.”

Many of the Pearce-manufactured smaller ships are considered stock patrol vessels for the Council of Peace, a force for good, watching over the light-speed Star Atlas network, which was founded at the signing of the Treaty of Peace by all 3 galactic faction leaders.

Pearce ships are made mainly of the resources that can be found in higher abundance in the MUD faction space (Tenon, Hicenium, Diamond).

If you ever want to build a Pearce ship yourself, you will need the respective blueprint. How to get one? You will need to get in a manufacturer’s good graces. To get there, you will have to prove that both your interests are aligned and/or that you’re supporting them. In in-game terms, you will need to gain loyalty (aka reputation) with them, before they judge you worthy of building ships with their logo on them (accruing loyalty won’t be possible before the SCORE v1 and CREAM v1 modules have been released).

Gaining loyalty to Pearce requires completing their missions. To gain access to these missions, you will either have to be a member of the MUD faction or you will need a faction passport. These passes function a little like real-world visas, allowing you to visit another faction’s territory and trade with them. More importantly, in this case, a faction pass will allow you to accept and complete missions for the manufacturers that are aligned to that faction. You can learn more about shipbuilding and blueprints in our [in-depth guide](https://aephia.com/star-atlas/star-atlas-shipbuilding-blueprints-loyalty/).

### A fully equipped Generation 1 model

![star atlas ship pearce f4 02](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/64c4358e806c46f16d3f228d966f8c458c3ac96475986d197d8678e483a2c498.jpg "star atlas ship pearce f4 02")

Remember that all ships bought through the GAO ([Galactic Asset Offering](https://staratlaswiki.org/wiki/GAO)), are delivered fully loaded. In later game stages, new ships will be barebone and only limited components are bespoke and fixed. So – you’re not only getting a Generation 1 model, but you’re also getting more bang for your buck!

However, the ships will still fully customizable. All the various modules can be changed/sold as needed as confirmed by Bunthius (Star Atlas CPO): “_The plan right now is that all GAO ships come with filled crew/component/module slots. You’ll be able to un-slot all these GAO filler items and sell them, and respec individually._”

### Earning potential of the Pearce F4

![star atlas ship pearce f4 05](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/31333029ea1660c07f7d31f83052b2a6fe0e4322a0c1cfe72c765d0c059bc326.jpg "star atlas ship pearce f4 05")

If you’re wondering how much you can earn with your Pearce F4 in Star Atlas, here are some facts:

Before Star Atlas releases the full game in the Unreal 5 engine, all players have the opportunity to participate in the browser game (called SCORE) with their ship NFTs to generate revenue (learn all the details about the [Star Atlas mini game](https://aephia.com/star-atlas/what-is-the-star-atlas-mini-game-score/) in our guide).

If the player provides his ship to his faction (ONI, MUD or Ustur), he will receive ATLAS, the in-game currency of Star Atlas, in return. This amount is measured by the **VWAP** (the “volume weighted average price” at which the ship was offered in the Galactic Asset Offering) of your ships. For the Pearce F4, the VWAP is **$2,840** USDC.

So if you have the opportunity to buy this ship at a price below the VWAP, this could be a good deal for you (of course no financial or ship advice).
