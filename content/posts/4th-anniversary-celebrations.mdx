**On July 18th, Aephia Industries celebrated its fourth anniversary as a Star Atlas DAC (guild)!**

This year, our daily _give-back-gifts_ to you, the Star Atlas community, took well over a week to finalize due to last-minute scheduling changes and COPA business behind the scenes.

Let’s go briefly over what we released, in case you missed something!

Aephia Industries Logo – 4th Anniversary Edition

## Thursday, July 18th

Aephia turns four! It’s crazy to think about, really. Less than four and a half years ago, the Star Atlas co-founders published their White Paper and revealed themselves to the public. A little over 5 months later, we opened our doors to the community. What a ride it has been! And we’re still going, stronger than ever!

In early 2022, we organized our first T-shirt design competition for Aephia Industries. A little over 3 years later, you can now purchase the winning entry, along with several other designs by the same creator. The winning entry comes with some surprises and is only available in a limited edition run!
Instead of waiting to build our own store, we are partnering with Galia Merchants to bring these shirts right to you!

SAGE Automation is an ever-developing field. Last year, we brought you a video tutorial on how to set up the SLY Assistent. This year, Viktor made two new tutorials for you all:

* The Standalone SLY Assistant
* The SLY Assistant Dashboards

Make sure to check these out to level up your automation game!

When C4 arrives, you need to understand the new map layout. There is a lot of confusion regarding the Regions in C4, so we created numerous visual examples to help drive home the new concept.

We wrote a short article about it, but the real value is in the two PDF decks attached at the end, which provide the visuals. Feel free to take those and show them off wherever you want to educate others.

## Tuesday, July 22nd

Perhaps our biggest announcement of the week: We launched a new Community Hub! It starts out with a Team (Discord) Message Tracker with various options to search and filter messages. And it offers a meetup calendar for Star Atlas meetings (get-togethers) taking place in the real world!

We have big plans for expanding this when C4 is out. Stay tuned!

As you read this, the Holosim beta has likely come to an end. But it will return in August! What better way to be prepared than by reading our latest guide, specially written for this game?

We’ve highlighted all the things that make Holosim special, and we’re planning another pass to fill in any remaining blanks before Holosim Season 1 goes live for real!

BeyondTheHorizon (Content Creator of the Year) played a game of Cataclysm: Battle for Iris, against none other than the master of lore: Jose (Lead Lore Writer on Star Atlas)!
In addition, we announced that this card game, which has been in development for a few years now, will host a public beta in September of this year!

Link your wallet. Verify your role. Unlock the galaxy. 

After sharing our plans during Quimeracon in 2022, we have finally launched AstralPass!
This is a powerful new verification and DAC onboarding platform, built for the entire Star Atlas community! It is currently undergoing internal testing, but we expect to open it up to everyone in late August.

AstralPass offers three things:

* It links Discord accounts to Solana wallets and in-game profiles, enabling DACs to manage roles automatically
* It helps with onboarding new members by providing a guided flow in Discord
* It provides valuable insights into a user’s activity (to the user) through its dashboard. This shows things such as the Player Profile(s), PIP Voting history, and Atlas & Polis Locker status. And we’re adding more during Q3 and Q4!

## Thank You!

As always, we had a blast sharing all of this original content with all of you over the past days! We would not be able to do this, or even be here, without all of you wonderful community members!
