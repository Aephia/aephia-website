Big news today! Or, put more accurately, news of _titanic_ proportions!

> A small group of Aephians has collaborated to secure **The Last Stand mk. VIII**.

This Titan ship is the latest, 8th-generation model of The Last Stand (TLS), the [Sogmian](https://lore.staratlas.com/species-and-races/directory/sogmian)\-built battleship that famously led to the end of the [Convergence War](https://lore.staratlas.com/history-of-the-galia-expanse/the-known-story/the-convergence-war) 100 years ago. The Mark VIII, built by the popular [ONI](https://lore.staratlas.com/galia-factions/oni) ship manufacturing powerhouse _Busan_, was among the first three Titan ships originally announced by ATMTA.

This Titan will be under the direct control of its owners and will fly the banner of [Aephia Industries](https://aephia.com). The TLS will enter into service right after Starbased goes live and will aid the [Ustur ](https://lore.staratlas.com/galia-factions/ustur)in securing their sector.
