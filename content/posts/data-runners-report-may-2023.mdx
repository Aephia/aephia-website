### NOTES

1.1 USERS – new faction registrations weekly

Faction registrations are wallets that have registered to one of the three factions. This is
a requirement for playing S.C.O.R.E. We are measuring new registrations within a week.

1.2 USERS – active users in S.C.O.R.E. monthly

Active users in S.C.O.R.E. are wallets that have made at least one transaction (e.g., refill, deposit, withdrawal) with the S.C.O.R.E. program within a month.

1.3 USERS – active users marketplace & lockers weekly

Active users on the marketplace are wallets that have at least made one trade in goods on the Star Atlas marketplace within a week. We excluded resources in this query because the count would then be very similar to active users in S.C.O.R.E. | Active users for the lockers are wallets that made at least one transaction with the ATLAS or the POLIS locker within a week.

2.1 LAND – claim stakes & CSS land trading volume daily

This is an aggregate of the ATLAS and USDC trade volumes within one day of the claim stakes & CSS land on the marketplace, primary and secondary market – measured in USDC.

2.2 SHIPS – star atlas marketplace ship volume daily

This is an aggregate of the ATLAS and USDC trade volumes of all ships on the marketplace within one day – measured in USDC.

2.4 SHIPS – buy vs. sell trading volume

A trade is executed when a market order is placed on the Star Atlas Marketplace. If the order is a buy, the best ask price will be filled. If it is a sell order, the best bid will be filled. We measure the trade volume of a buy order placed at the market as buy trade volume and the trade volume of a sell order placed at the market as sell trade volume. When an order is placed as a limit order, no trade is made but liquidity is provided. The chart shows the 7 day average percentage of the total trading volume for buy trading volume and sell trading volume. We believe this chart should be interpreted as a sentiment indicator.

2.5 MARKETPLACE – ATLAS vs. USDC total trading volume

We measure the total trading volume for all assets on the Star Atlas marketplace for ATLAS and USDC. The chart shows the 7 day average percentage of the total trading volume for ATLAS and USDC.

3.1 DAO – star atlas DAO treasury

The Star Atlas DAO Treasury comes from two sources. First, the R4s sold on the marketplace for ATLAS go to the DAO treasury. Second, a marketplace fee has been introduced. One third of that fee goes to the DAO treasury. Those fees are collected in ATLAS and USDC, depending on the currency of the traded good. This chart shows the marketplace fees collected in USDC for the DAO treasury.

5.1 ACTIVITY – players activity over factions

Active players in S.C.O.R.E. are wallets that have made at least one transaction (e.g., refill, deposit, withdrawal) with the S.C.O.R.E. program within a month. The active and inactive players are divided into the three factions.

5.2 ACTIVITY – firepower over factions

Active players in S.C.O.R.E. are wallets that have made at least one transaction (e.g. refill, deposit,
withdrawal) with the S.C.O.R.E. program within a month. It has been shared in the foundation room discord channel that the multiplier for component sizes has been changed. The old furmula was “two Small class components equate to roughly 73,5% of the output of one Medium component”. The new formula is “one medium component is 2.5x the output of one small component”. If we assume that a missile bay has twice the firepower of a weapon hardpoint and we set the firepower of an XXS weapon hardpoint to 1, then we can calculate the firepower for each ship and thus for an entire faction. Max firepower is the player with the highest firepower of each faction.
