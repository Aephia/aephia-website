The Fimbul ECOS Treearrow takes a slice out of pre-MUDian earth era biomes and creates a portable living vessel welcoming to all of humankind. All peoples who feel stranded and abandoned by the traumatizing break humanity experienced when they loosened themselves from Mother Earth’s nurturing embrace can find a grounding home aboard the ECOS Treearrow. Equipped for terrifying planetary destruction, discovering this ship in your atmosphere is rarely ever a good omen. Unless, of course, it is above Earth Prime, the new home of the ECOS ideologues who terraformed a distant planet to match humanity’s one true biome and where you can find these ships being built with delicate care.

### A fully equipped Generation 1 model

Remember that all ships bought through the GAO ([Galactic Asset Offering](https://staratlaswiki.org/wiki/GAO)), are delivered fully loaded. In later game stages, new ships will be barebone and only limited components are bespoke and fixed. So – you’re not only getting a Generation 1 model, but you’re also getting more bang for your buck!

However, the ships will still be fully customizable. All the various modules can be changed/sold as needed as confirmed by Bunthius (Star Atlas CPO): “_The plan right now is that all GAO ships come with filled crew/component/module slots. You’ll be able to un-slot all these GAO filler items and sell them, and respec individually._”

### Earning potential of the Fimbul ECOS Treearrow

If you’re wondering how much you can earn with your Fimbul ECOS Treearrow in Star Atlas, here are some facts:

Before Star Atlas releases the full game in the Unreal 5 engine, all players have the opportunity to participate in the browser game (called SCORE) with their ship NFTs to generate revenue (learn all the details about the [Star Atlas mini game](https://aephia.com/star-atlas/what-is-the-star-atlas-mini-game-score/) in our guide).

If the player provides his ship to his faction (ONI, MUD or Ustur), he will receive ATLAS, the in-game currency of Star Atlas, in return. This amount is measured by the **VWAP** (the “volume weighted average price” at which the ship was offered in the Galactic Asset Offering) of your ships. For the Fimbul ECOS Treearrow, the VWAP is **$105,250** USDC.

So if you have the opportunity to buy this ship at a price below the VWAP, this could be a good deal for you (of course no financial or ship advice).
