Now that the Star Atlas marketplace offers the possibility to buy the ships not yet sold by the dev team with the in-game currency ATLAS, some bargains can be made.

However, this opportunity could soon be diminished. Namely, when the prices in ATLAS are adjusted to the current exchange rate in USDC: “We will be rebalancing soon. For now, all of the rates are favorable to users, and we aren’t concerned about the immediate liquidation of ATLAS proceeds, so we don’t have it prioritized”, so CEO Michael Wagner.

“It will probably rebalance early next week. We will be coordinating with comms to provide 24/48 hour notice prior to rebalance.”
