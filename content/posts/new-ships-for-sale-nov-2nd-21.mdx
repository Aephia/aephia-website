Star Atlas just [tweeted a teaser](https://twitter.com/staratlas/status/1455142708205559811) for the two new ships that will go on sale Thursday 4th November. The ships in question, appear to be the medium-sized Rainbow Om, and the large-sized Pierce R8\. The Rainbow Om is the 2nd and last freighter to go on sale from all the known ships. The other being the [Fimbul BYOS Packlite](https://play.staratlas.com/market/BeqGJwPnRb3fJwhSrfhzgUYKqegUtGtvXajTYzEpgGYr). While the Pierce R8, is the only currently known repair/refuel ship. Since both are rare, and models are limited for the roles they cover, demand is expected to be high for both.
