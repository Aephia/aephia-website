As the team approaches Christmas and their (subsequent) two weeks off, they are crunching hard, trying to push some more releases out this year. We’ll likely hear more about those efforts on Tuesday when they host their last Town Hall of the year!

But we had an interesting week, this past week as well! The highly anticipated release of the 3D version of SAGE, whose graphics have enamored many, finally went live! And we had the GAM3 Awards, of course.

Let’s dive right in!

SAGE 3D – ONI CSS

## SAGE 3D

On Thursday of last week (Friday for some, in typical Star Atlas release fashion), the team launched the [3D (WebGL) version of SAGE](https://x.com/staratlas/status/1735066264228524484?s=20)! This is not yet SAGE Starbased, as no Starbase-related gameplay is present. It also lacks some of the later feature additions to SAGE Labs that make gameplay more convenient. However, it does come with a much better-looking interface.

You can jump in straight away by visiting [https://sage.staratlas.com](https://sage.staratlas.com/)!

Note that the 3D SAGE and SAGE Labs are two different interfaces to the same game. This means you can seamlessly (well, sort of; it could require a refresh) switch between both interfaces while controlling your fleets.

The team did point out in advance that they are aware the 3D SAGE is still a little buggy. If you get stuck, please use the SAGE Labs interface to enjoy the game.

GAM3 Awards – People’s Choice: Star Atlas

## GAM3 Awards

Last week, the Game3 Awards award ceremony took place. Star Atlas secured nominations in 5 different categories, and of course, everyone wanted to see how many prizes they would bring home. Perhaps even more interesting to the community, the team also debuted [a new gameplay trailer](https://x.com/GAM3Sgg_/status/1735334308473180295?s=20) during the event!

A [#GAM3Awards](https://twitter.com/hashtag/GAM3Awards?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) exclusive trailer from [@staratlas](https://twitter.com/staratlas?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [pic.twitter.com/sUIUU0iPAJ](https://t.co/sUIUU0iPAJ)
</XTweet>
 

Many expected Star Atlas to win in the “Most Anticipated” category, but this unfortunately did not come to pass (baffling many, to say the least). Ultimately, the only prize the team managed to secure was the _People’s Choice_ award. This, at the least, demonstrates that the Star Atlas community is the best out there! 

Note that for every other category, the community vote only counted for 10% in determining the final winner. The other 90% was done by the organization. This likely explains why our passionate community could not push Star Atlas over the finish line in the other categories.

## Starpath Fees

When StarPath V2 was launched in September, the team made a deal with BuddyLink that saw them waive their fee on reward claims for 90 days. That period is now coming to an end this Wednesday, December 20th.

If you claim any USDC or ATLAS rewards from that day on, those claims will be **subject to a 3% fee**. It does not matter if you earned those rewards before December 20th; the fee will be subtracted when you claim them. In other words, make sure to claim your rewards before the 20th to ensure you get the most out of your referral rewards!

## Town Hall

This Tuesday, December 19th, the team will host their [very last Town Hall](https://discord.com/events/789226204980707409/1184549669506908250) of the year! As always, this will occur on the [Star Atlas Discord](https://discord.com/events/789226204980707409/1184549669506908250), which will kick off at 18:00 UTC!

The event’s description reads: “We will be doing a 2023 rewind, sharing product updates and what to look forward to in 2024!”

We will hear more about the last two releases that the team is trying to get out this week, the DAC Platform and the Showroom R2.1.9 release. This R2.1.9 release will showcase the current state of most things planned for R2.2 (tentatively targeted at the end of Q1 2024). More details will be shared during the meeting.

In addition, we’ll get an “economic update” focused on SAGE (Labs) and no doubt a mention of the Honeyland collab.

![Honeyland x Star Atlas](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/c99e46ac003685995d96c6b92d1e7f27ad09a957828a3fad3c8a1c583665ea0a.jpg)

## Honeyland

The Honeyland collaboration is starting on December 19th (if all goes well), as part of a new update to SAGE (Labs). You can redeem resources harvested/crafted in SAGE for special Honeyland SFTs. There will be 100 of these SFTs available, and these will yield you a Generation 1 Bee egg for the Honeyland game (value about 0.3 SOL) and a badge in the Honeyland game to commemorate this first step in the collaboration with Honeyland.

It’s important to know that only one badge can be received per player (wallet?), and these rewards come on a First-come, First-serve (FCFS) basis.

## ATLAS-only Markets

Last week, after repricing all team-sold assets the week before, the team removed the USDC-side markets for all resources traded on the Galactic Marketplace. This means you can no longer trade your R4 (Consumables), R9 (Raw Materials), Compound Materials, SDUs, and Components in USDC over there.

In their announcement, the team referred to both resources & skins, seeing their USDC market removed, but so far, the skins are still available. It’s unclear whether the team plans to implement this change anytime soon (or at all).

## End of Year

With the end of the year approaching, it’s good to know that the coming week is the last week we can expect anything from the team for 2023\. The team will go on a 2-week holiday starting this weekend, and by the time they get back to work, it will be the second week of January 2024.

It remains to be seen whether the team will manage to roll out the initial release of the DAC Platform and the Unreal Engine R2.1.9 release.

### CORE

Though we expected the **_alternate_** cover of CORE issue #11 (Act 2, episode 5) to arrive this past week, we’ve since learned that it can be expected this week.

Star Atlas – Golden Ticket Raffle – Week 8 Prizes

## Golden Ticket Raffle – Week 8

Week 7 of the Golden Ticket raffles is behind us, and the [prizes](https://hedgehog.markets/star-atlas/63EDiLoPz9SDYcyXoF1d1EZ8NbcNmX1G9XFfevuC8Ns8) have been distributed to the various winners since. The very last week of the raffle, [week 8](https://hedgehog.markets/star-atlas/6Rm44bu5Exz6hSCi7qKRnzYV7fbycEg3y29zZKEyaDrg), has already started, and this is the very last time you will be able to join this specific raffle.

The big difference between previous weeks and week 8 is that the community has been able to influence the rewards available through various polls that were published by the team. The big ticket items are the Tier 4 Claim Stakes, plus the Armstrong IMP, Rainbow Arc, Opal Bitboat, and Ogrika Sunpaa ships.

### Golden Tickets

Going forward, there seem to be plans to keep Golden Tickets around and give them some utility. It looks like we’ll hear more on Tuesday during the Town Hall. If this does not come to pass, then make sure to submit your tickets before the deadline for the Week 8 raffle runs out!

## Checkpoint ’23

Almost exactly a year ago, guild leaders from four different guilds, Santi (Community Director) & Metaverse Explorer (Content Creator), came together to host a [2.5-hour long talk show](https://www.youtube.com/live/A2MgLSPOpeQ?si=PsPEnJWQnzoE_dZ6) about the past, present, and future of Star Atlas, which was dubbed **Star Atlas: Checkpoint**. Though they discussed the various highlights that occurred during that time, there was also room to go into their personal lowlights.

This year, there will be another Checkpoint talkshow, showing a slightly different cast of guild leaders. Like last year, the topics and approach to the show remain the same. Regarding _the_ _past_, the panel will pick up where the last one left off, focusing primarily on 2023 this time around, to ensure there is no overlap. This should definitely be [worth a watch](https://www.youtube.com/live/tdmXFtdr-2c?si=NnPXH4eC4tjZNU9S)!

## Breakpoint ’24

Before we wrap this issue up, it may be good to know that you can now [get tickets](https://solana.com/breakpoint) for Solana Breakpoint 2024, which takes place in the Suntec Convention & Exhibition Centre in Singapore, through a limited-time presale event. This may not matter to most, but we figured we would include it here just in case. Note that you do not need this ticket to attend the Star Atlas Community meetup!

## Story Writing Competition

Lastly, we want to share that Aephia is currently organizing a [short-story writing competition](https://aephia.com/star-atlas/a-merry-christmas-star-atlas-writing-competition/) that you may want to participate in. See the [original announcement](https://aephia.com/star-atlas/a-merry-christmas-star-atlas-writing-competition/) for more information! The submission deadline is December 24th, so you have a few more days to put your creativity to work.

_See you next week!_
