With the _Star Atlas IMPACT Summit_ rapidly approaching, the past week has been _very_ light on news. Nevertheless, the Council elections are in full swing, with the past Atlas Brew being dedicated to interviewing all the candidates. We also unearthed some never-before-seen concept art. Lastly, circling back to the IMPACT Summit, the team released a few new details!

_Let’s dive in!_

## Council Elections

The Council election season is now in full swing! Before voting kicks off, the community is given the opportunity to get to know the candidates and ask them questions.

Last week, during an extended [Atlas Brew,](https://youtu.be/5VXDeMnXr3Y) all 22 candidates were allowed to present themselves, each getting a maximum of 5 minutes to do so. It was informative and a great way to learn more about the individuals who want to serve on the council.

If you are short on time, community member Beth summarized each candidate [on X](https://twitter.com/bnBeth_solvax/status/1829935343812084138?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1829935343812084138%7Ctwgr%5Eef9ee18692536cd3671fa9d9c02c3880cecfa67c%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Faephia.com%2Fwp-admin%2Fpost.php%3Fpost%3D15393action%3Dedit) in a little over 7 minutes instead. It, of course, lacks some of the nuances, but it’s a great way to start your journey into learning more.

## IMPACT – Star Atlas Summit

Preparations for the first-ever Star Atlas conference, the IMPACT Summit, are well underway! This full-day conference will take place on September 21st, starting at 10 AM and wrapping up at 6 PM. The team is planning various team presentations, sneak peeks, and fireside chats with team members throughout the day! On top of that, the Hackathon winners will be announced, and there is a Surge tournament going on in which attendees can participate, with the finals being live-streamed on stage.

The whole event will also be live-streamed through YouTube, so you can stay fully up to speed, even from the confines of your home (or office)! This also means you can catch a recording later if you cannot tune in live.

If you are attending, please [register using this Lu.ma link](https://lu.ma/3728vl8l). Over 500 others have already done so, but the expectation is that many more Breakpoint attendees will also–at least briefly–explore what is going on the floor beneath them. Especially with access being free for all!

The team has also announced that all attendees will get a free Ogrika Rucha IMPACT Skin to add to their collection!
