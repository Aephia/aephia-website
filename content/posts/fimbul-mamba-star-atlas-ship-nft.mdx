Built for the driven bounty hunter, the Mamba has everything you need and nothing you don’t. 38m of pure, lean bounty hunting machine to aid you in the thrill of the chase. This ship exudes vintage grit from top to bottom. Now with support for you and three crew. Secure your quarry in our no frills, back-to-basics brig that will have your captives humming jailhouse blues, or put them in stasis for that extra oomph. Detain with Delight™ Disclaimer of Warranty: Fimbul Mamba and brig are provided “as is.” Fimbul makes no express or implied warranty as to the condition of the brig or its fitness for the particular purpose of keeping bounties detained in the brig comfortable (or even alive).

### A fully equipped Generation 2 model

Remember that all ships bought through the GAO ([Galactic Asset Offering](https://staratlaswiki.org/wiki/GAO)), are delivered fully loaded. In later game stages, new ships will be barebone and only limited components are bespoke and fixed. So – you’re not only getting a Generation 2 model, but you’re also getting more bang for your buck!

However, the ships will still fully customizable. All the various modules can be changed/sold as needed as confirmed by Bunthius (Star Atlas CPO): “_The plan right now is that all GAO ships come with filled crew/component/module slots. You’ll be able to un-slot all these GAO filler items and sell them, and respec individually._”

### Earning potential of the Fimbul Mamba

If you’re wondering how much you can earn with your Fimbul Mamba in Star Atlas, here are some facts:

Before Star Atlas releases the full game in the Unreal 5 engine, all players have the opportunity to participate in the browser game (called SCORE) with their ship NFTs to generate revenue (learn all the details about the [Star Atlas mini game](https://aephia.com/star-atlas/what-is-the-star-atlas-mini-game-score/) in our guide).

If the player provides his ship to his faction (ONI, MUD or Ustur), he will receive ATLAS, the in-game currency of Star Atlas, in return. This amount is measured by the **VWAP** (the “volume weighted average price” at which the ship was offered in the Galactic Asset Offering) of your ships. For the Fimbul Mamba, the VWAP is **$1,881** USDC.

So if you have the opportunity to buy this ship at a price below the VWAP, this could be a good deal for you (of course no financial or ship advice).
