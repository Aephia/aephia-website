If you’ve been around online games for a while, you may remember the Blizzard forums, in which case, you’ve probably used Blizzard’s legendary **Blue Tracker**.

It is a simple feed that pulled together every developer post across countless threads. Whenever a Blizzard dev dropped a nugget of insight—or a cryptic teaser—it would light up in blue, standing out sharply against the sea of white community messages. And thanks to the Blue Tracker, you didn’t need to scour the forums to find it. It just _showed up_, neatly collected on a dedicated page.

That iconic blue might’ve started with Blizzard (though no one ever officially confirmed it), but it didn’t end there. Over the years, many games and communities (such as **Star Citizen** and **Star Atlas**) have followed suit, using blue to highlight developer or team posts. And Blue Trackers? They became a staple for dedicated fans, cutting through the noise to deliver the signal. These days, almost every major studio uses some version of a Blue Tracker.

But there has been one glaring omission … until now.

Proudly presenting: AtlasBase!

We’re excited to unveil **[AtlasBase](https://atlasbase.io)**, a Star Atlas hub built _by_ the community, _for_ the community, and a new initiative by **Aephia Industries**.

At launch, AtlasBase features two (we hope) helpful tools:

## 🟦 Blue Tracker

Our take on the classic Blue Tracker, tailored for Star Atlas and its primary gathering place: **Discord**.

We track and surface messages from official team members across all key public channels. The feed is filterable, searchable, and saves you from endlessly scrolling to find a passing comment that might have been posted at 3 a.m. your time. Sure, Discord’s search works—but only if you already _know_ what you’re looking for.

AtlasBase – Team Tracker

A Blue Tracker flips that around. It provides you with full awareness of everything being said by the team. No fear of missing out, no wondering what flew under the radar, you just check in and stay effortlessly up to date.

This only recently became possible thanks to **Darwiin**, ATMTA’s support superhero and a rising star in the vibe-coder scene, who built a Discord bot that exports team messages via API. Thanks to his work, we can now present official communications in a clear, centralized, and easy-to-follow manner.

## 🌍 Meetup Dashboard (with 3D Map)

_Star Atlas is more than a game; it’s a global community._

Over the past few years, we’ve seen only a handful of real-life meetups, with roughly half of them organized by **Funcracker** around the **Solana Breakpoint** conferences. But 2025 seems to mark a turning point!

With the DAO’s Ecosystem Fund opening up, and recent initiatives like the **Community Meetup Fund** (_[Iris Bounty: The Feast](https://govern.staratlas.com/proposals/f15380c9-8d3f-4849-8185-c29f4c72e961)_) being approved, we’re now seeing more organized gatherings, not necessarily taking place alongside events where the team has a presence.

With this new wave of energy, it was high time to bring some structure and visibility to what’s happening across the world.

AtlasBase – Meetup Dashboard

Enter the **Meetup Dashboard**.

At the top of the page, you’ll find a **3D Earth** with pins marking upcoming meetup locations, a fun, interactive way to visualize the community’s global footprint. But the real utility lies just below: a **chronological list** of all upcoming events, complete with dates, locations, and links. Whether you’re organizing, attending, or just curious, it’s now easier than ever to stay in the loop.

👉 Want your meetup featured? Just **DM Funcracker** (DMs are open) and we’ll get it added.

## **Why AtlasBase?**

AtlasBase is just getting started.

Our vision is to grow it into a **mainstay utility hub** for the entire Star Atlas community, a living base of operations packed with valuable tools, data, and insights.

The Blue Tracker and Meetup Dashboard are just the opening salvo. _There’s much more to come._

So go check it out. Bookmark it. Share it. And let us know what _you_ want to see next.
