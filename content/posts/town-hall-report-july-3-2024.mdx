The second Town Hall of the year (#43) took place on Wednesday, July 3rd, a day before the 4th of July festivities weekend kicked off in the US Community Week. Santi (Community Director) and Michael (CEO) were joined on stage by various team members, announcing a host of changes and updates.

Below, you can find our report/summary of the event. If you prefer to listen/watch back, then do check out [our recording](https://youtu.be/CayIW3FFlFg).

The Town Hall took well over two hours and was jam-packed with news, updates, and a good few unexpected announcements!

## Introduction

Santi and Michael are on stage, and one welcome change is that both of them have their cameras turned on so we can see their faces.

![Screenshot 2024 07 03 at 21.06.15](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/14499fccc6ed9b90cc75ab26e297420fd29284cca502fa0d40f08a65ee558cda.png)

Michael “SW4GN3R” Wagner (CEO) and Santi (Community Director)

The team starts with some quick updates.

Santi is announcing the _Rare Evo_ meetup in Las Vegas (August 15-17). Santi, Michael, Dominic, and Miguel will represent the team. They will have a booth with four gaming stations set up. The team is also collaborating with Shaga and will do some DePIN cloud-streaming with them (to mobile, most likely).

Before Breakpoint, Michael (and perhaps other team members) will also attend _BitCoin Nashville_ (July 25-27).

After Breakpoint, in November, the team also plans to be present and do something at the YGG event in the Philippines.

## New Hires

The team has been scaling very slowly and strategically. Since the beginning of the year, the team has hired **11 new full-time employees**. Beyond three Philippines & Thailand content creators & moderators, they hired a sr. concept artists, sr. game designer, game architect, creative designer, two sr. full stack engineers, two level designers, and a director of Security Engineering. Lastly, Dan Park (legal council) is back!

Additionally, they hired an additional **8 short-term contractors**, primarily concept artists who are working on Crew cards and packs.

## State of the Economy

Gareth (Economic Analyst) joins Santi and Michael on stage and quickly goes over the [second Economic Quarterly Report](https://staratlas.com/newsroom/economic-reports/star-atlas-economic-report-2024-q2) for 2024 (released live). The GDP grew by 6.24% over Q2.

With the transition from Council RFR to Loyalty Points in Starbased, daily emissions have been much more stable. Participation has also grown by 300% (4x as many players participate in LP, compared to crafted Council RFRs). 

The next Economic Forum (#3) will occur on Thursday, August 1st.

## Builders / Developer Program

The team will provide free access to RPC calls for community builders! Interested parties need to apply for this through a [form](https://build.staratlas.com/creative-assets/forms/developer-rpc-initiative), as the team does want to make sure people are using those calls effectively. In addition, the project has to be open for everyone to use.

As RPC calls can become quite expensive, this will allow community builders to explore avenues that were simply too cost-prohibitive before.

Another Developer Hour event will take place on July 18th, 17:00 UTC, during which community members can ask some of the team’s developers questions.

## Breakpoint

Star Atlas will have a _huge presence_ at Breakpoint (20 & 21 September) this year! Michael mentions that after the past two years, it feels appropriate to flex their muscles this year. One small part of that is that at least 25 people from the team will be in attendance.

Breakpoint will take place on the 3rd and 4th floors of the Suntec Conference building in Singapore. The 4th floor is reserved for the conference itself, while the 3rd floor will host a number of side events during and before the main event.

![Screenshot 2024 07 03 at 21.32.09](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/6913913d115f97b9aa7e596e4b0e7a4e9a45fa0bccbbf5aa3b09fe13259d41bf.png)

Breakpoint ’24 – Concept Visual of the Gamer Village on the 4th Floor (center)

Michael will give a 15-minute presentation on the main stage during the conference. As before, they will employ a good few gameplay videos to spruce things up a bit.

In addition, the team is (co)sponsoring the Gamer Village, which will be right at the center of the conference (4th) floor.

But the real biggie.. is the Star Atlas Summit!

## Star Atlas Summit

On the 21st, the team is kicking off a major side event that will take place parallel to the Breakpoint conference. It will occur on the 3rd floor and is dubbed the _Star Atlas Summit_!

This is the **first-ever Star Atlas conference**. The team secured a side event on the 3rd floor for a full-day, 8-hour conference! No ticket (including Breakpoint) is required. Programming is:

* Fireside chat with Danny (CPO) after lunch
* Panels with team members
* Team presentations
* Panels with Community members, DACs, IP builders
* Exhibition – offer booths to DACs (for free)
* Special announcements related to the DAO (at the conference)

There will be a Surge Tournament running the full day as well. The team will set up 12 PCs on the 3rd floor for teams to participate, for 3 teams of 4 players each. The team encourages attendees to form squads already. There will be prizes for the winners. The plan is to live-stream the semi-finals and finals on the main stage. Of course, the full-day Summit will be streamed as well.

## Hackathon

The team is launching its first Hackathon very soon (see also the DAO section at the bottom of this post)! Only new feature development is considered to qualify for participation. Ogrika (the in-game manufacturer) will immersively sponsor the hackathon.

The Hackathon will be launched soon, with a ceremony and the selection (and presentation) of the winner at the Star Atlas Summit.

## Crew Packs

Of course, everyone was awaiting news concerning the Crew launch. To kick off this topic, the team showed off a short teaser video showing a few variations of the Ustur crew members. Michael stated there is a much longer video, which will be released later.

Michael quickly summarizes what Crew Members represent in Star Atlas. He also refers to the Perk Sheet the community team reviewed during the previous two Atlas Brews.

The big question: _Wen_?

Michael said it was hotly debated internally, but they will not give us a date just yet \[Later, it was made clear they did not want to overshadow the DAO launch announcement\].

Michael added that Crew will be one of the team’s most critical releases this year (maybe for a while longer even), so they want to get it right. The revenue potential for the team here is quite significant. A little consideration of market conditions also made the team push the date back.

The team also really wants to create a significant marketing push. They are currently reaching out and orchestrating the biggest marketing push ever. This may be the _last big new asset class_ the team will launch, and they really want to get this one right.

One benefit of this is that all crew art will be done. Michael explained that the original plan was to go live with MUD and use placeholder art for ONI and Ustur crew members. However, the team is working hard to get us the art for the ONI and Ustur crew as well, and they will wrap this up in time for the launch.

All that said, a **date will still be announced very soon,** and the launch is also not that far off!

### Sale Planning

When the sale is announced, the team will release the snapshot and airdrop dates as well. 

* The ship **snapshot** will be taken **two days before** Crew packs will go on sale. Every ship you own will be accounted for, including ships in SCORE, SAGE, and the Galactic Marketplace. There is less clarity about what happens with ships that are on 3rd party service escrows (e.g., marketplaces).
* The next day (**one day** **before** the sale) will be the **airdrops** of the crew and component bundles.

A special app will be built into the marketplace that allows people to open the crew packs, providing a cool experience.

When opening packs, you can select the number of packs you want to open, but you can also toggle an option to insert the Crew members right away into SAGE Starbased. Getting them into SAGE will be an intensive process if you want to get hundreds of crew into that game without using that option.

Michael once again clarified that ship prices set by ATMTA’s won’t change after the Crew/Component bundle drop. These drops are bonuses for early purchasers.

![Star Atlas - Crew Faction Leaders](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/8639293b27105f1321c783c75bb11bebe6150834ca98f471fdbbcad0380ff2d4.png)

Star Atlas – Crew Faction Leaders

### Faction Leader Campaign

The team was able to build out an additional campaign around Faction leaders!

Faction leaders are going to be released alongside the crew members. Players who collect 5 different rarities (from common up to legendary) of the same faction crew will join the raffle. Multiple sets will count as multiple entries.

The three winners will receive an anomaly-level Crew card representing that Faction’s leader. This card comes with additional (temporary!) perks, such as:

* Tier 5 Hab space on the (respective) CSS
* Large (unique 1/1!) ship with Tier 5 components
* Dedicated office space on The Cradle (Council of Peace Station)

Note that these perks last for a year, after which another player may have a chance at scoring the new Faction Leader (and those perks). You will get to keep the crew card, however!

_Sidenote from Michael: Danny and Jose have been chatting about some of the other perks, not only for the Faction leaders, but for the VIP Polis stakeholders. There are political offices across the Central Space Stations and The Cradle (COP Station). This office space will be available to the Faction Leader and high PVP holders._

## Roadmap Updates

The team will update the Roadmap on Tuesday, focusing more on features that have a higher impact on Star Atlas. The team has been thinking very strategically about their roadmap, focusing on new user acquisition. 

So, the team has been thinking about what they can do now to show off at Breakpoint. There is a focus on repeatable, enjoyable gameplay loops.

The team reworked the Roadmap for UE5 significantly. Read on to learn more!

## Unreal Engine 5

The team has radically overhauled its Unreal Engine 5 roadmap! A UE5 R2.2 release will no longer be forthcoming; instead, the next release will be dubbed _Preseason_. It will also come with different features, as the most significant of the R2.2 features have been moved to the release after Preseason, which will be Season 0\. Preseason content will be shown off at Breakpoint and launched later this year.

To start with Season 0, this will come with:

* Racing & Combat Racing
* Racing career
* Ioki open world
* Progression and XP system

This will be open to the public and launch in 2025.

The Preseason (that will come before) will come with:

* Surge (3rd person shooter) – Smaller maps, different maps, different environments, instance-based gameplay (smaller teams), 24/7  
  * Team Deathmatch
  * Gungame – Kills level up your gun
  * VIP mode (See Hunted mod for Half-Life)
  * Tie econ elements into this (rewards)
* Fleet Command – Manage Fleet & jump into your ship with the flick of a switch  
  * SAGE is hard to pitch/sell
  * Hard to enjoy for small players
  * On AtlasNet (test net), the team is able to provide a way for players to experiment with the game without any fees
* ONI CSS  
  * Opening auction system to select land plot
  * Brand deals (e.g., Topper ATMs)
  * There will be challenges for players – This is where they are currently really focussing on with MetaGravity, as this is the Social Hub.
* Project Galia
* More advanced anti-cheat systems
* Fully upgraded Flight model – will feel more realistic
* Pets – Characters have a pet slot

## SAGE / Fleet Command

Future of the browser version of SAGE: The team will continue to support that product until they get Fleet Command to a state where they can get that available to low end & mobile devices. In the meantime, the team will maintain both, and they will retain feature parity.

## Tech Update

Brett is joining the stage. Michael shared that Brett was recently promoted to head of engineer. Brett shed light on a number of tech developments the team is working on.

### Marketplace V3

The team is starting work on a new V3 marketplace to solve all the issues they noticed over time with V2\. An important feature is adding support for (c)NFTs. Other features:

* Using the same liquidity to make multiple bids (first one accepted will invalidate the others)
* Support for bundles (creatable by users as well). Any asset can be mixed and matched
* Integrating some more APIs so the community can access data
* Direct integration with credit cards
* Historical price charts

The target launch date is the end of the year (Q4).

### StarComm V2

Early this year, the team started working on a new version of StarComm, which has a similar concept but many improvements. They are now getting close to the moment when they can deploy this new version. The team plans to slowly update the Play-portal, starting with the smaller features and ending with SAGE, as that is the biggest lift.

This new version should offer massive reliability & speed improvements. To illustrate the latter, the average latency should drop from 2-3 seconds to 150 ms!

_Important note for builders:_ The team plans to unlock StarComm V2 access to the community through their Build Program as well!

### Starframe

Most Solana programs are developed using Anchor, but the team has been hitting limits using that, which slowed down their development. So, they have been working on a replacement dubbed Starframe. It is being developed right now, and they plan to open-source it afterward. Marketplace V3 will be built with it.

It will be more complicated to use it than Anchor, as it unlocks lower-level Solana functionality.

### Ironforge

Originally, the team had a single RPC provider. Now, Ironforge is being used, which aggregates multiple RPC providers and sends individual requests to all of them. This has resulted in a jump in the success rate of requests to 99%, whereas before, they sometimes had a 70% failure rate.

A nice benefit is that Ironforge allows the team to hide their RPCs, allowing them to prevent abuse by others. In the past 3rd parties sometimes hijacked their RPC connections and ran their own on-chain instructions over it. With this new solution, the team locked things down well. 

### Solana Improvements Impact

Can we build this game on-chain?

Brett is very positive about Solana. Priority Fees are also a great addition, especially now that they work.

## Project Galia

Next, the team showed off a video of Project Galia (part of UE5 pre-season), which is basically opening up the Galia Expanse to players through deep space travel. Not only will players be able to fly from one planet to the next, but there will also be space stations, ship-to-asteroid combat, and third-person combat on foot, all seamlessly integrated into one environment. Effectively, it’s the **foundation of Star Atlas**.

Brad (MagicPuncher) joined the stage to talk some more about this, as he has been the lead developer on this.

<YouTube id="Hfh_I4gwDGw" title="Project Galia - Early preview - WIP"  />
 

Right now, there are two systems, one for ONI and one for MUD.

A common complaint is that it takes forever to get where you are going, so Brad sped that up in this game.

Players can fly from space to the ground without any loading screens. There will be full ship-to-ship combat and combat on foot. Initially no local markets, as there won’t be on-chain stuff. But that will come after StarComm V2 is live.

A future upgrade would be some form of missions.

## Ship Rentals

Michael hopes that Ship Rental will arrive this year but cautions that development is done by a third party. That said, this past Monday, the team successfully integrated the third-party program into their development environment! In short, the Front End still needs to be built, but from a technology standpoint, everything works! 

The team may introduce a pay-over-time plan to get a ship, empowering people to get in, play, and pay for the ship over time.

Michael expects more interest from investors as well. This is where SCORE can be deprecated completely.

## One Last Thing – DAO

Yves (aka Xeanor – ATMTA developer) whipped up a version of the DAO that will let the team bring this live much sooner than they expected. It won’t have Discourse on-chain available for discussion, so this will happen on Discord. A new category will be going live there with multiple channels to manage the governance. This is a hybrid solution for now, the goal still is to bring everything on-chain over time.

**This is going to be rolled out on Monday, July 8th!** The first 2 proposals will roll out on that date and voting opens on Wednesday, July 10th.

Not all proposals will be deemed valid initially. The DAO has been building up an impressive treasury these last few years, and Michael shared that the DAO will first focus on that treasury and treasury management. For example, he is thinking of a proposal for Hackathon prizes.

Wrapping up the event, Dan Park joins the stage and goes over the history of the DAO and what we can expect on Monday.

There will be four PIPs on Monday. These will lay the groundwork for what is to come.

* PIP-1: Lays the groundwork for how proposals work, how to create a proposal, discuss it, revise it, and how to vote on them.
* PIP-2: Ratifies the operations of the Star Atlas Foundation—The Cayman entity that supports the DAO
* PIP-3: Foundation for Council (elections coming soon after)—Community Team & Dan will form the council before the council has been elected.
* PIP-4: Create ecosystem fund—Carve out a portion of the treasury to be used exclusively for ecosystem growth. This allows community builders to make a proposal to get a slice of that fund.

There will be only a couple of days of providing feedback on these proposals.

There is a Medium article coming that goes deeper into all of this.

## Q&A

**Q (Gan-FaLL)**: I have POLIS locked in a compromised account. Can I transfer that?

**A:** Should be resolved at some point, but it is more a question for Brett.

**Q (DrumCarlos):** Worried about the Player Profiles. When is account delegation coming?

**A:** Maybe in Q4, but again, a question for Brett. 
Brett chimes in to say that Marketplace V3 will support it, and it will roll out to other products over time after that goes live.
