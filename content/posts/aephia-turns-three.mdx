_Three years ago, on July 18th, 2021, Prometheus & Funcracker officially opened the doors to one of the first Star Atlas DACs (Decentralized Autonomous Corporations—aka guilds. [Aephia Industries](https://aephia.com)‘ vision has_ _resonated with well over 2000 Star Atlas enthusiasts since then. It’s your support that has brought us to where we are today. Thank you for choosing to build your Star Atlas home with us and for all the support you’ve provided!_

_These past few years have been challenging for the Star Atlas community, with many early supporters moving away from Star Atlas and even from crypto (gaming) altogether. However_, _you are still with us, and that is what matters most! The team continues to build, and we remain building right alongside them._

_If you’ve recently joined the community, are still looking for a DAC to join, and are excited by the economic opportunities offered by Star Atlas’ 4X/Grand Strategy gameplay, we invite you to consider Aephia Industries. We would welcome you with open arms, keeping you up-to-date with the latest news, gameplay, and strategies!_

**Congratulations, Aephians!** We’re three years into the Star Atlas roller coaster, and we’ve certainly been through a lot together! The brutal bear cycle, the significant delay of the mini-game (SAGE), shifting priorities within the team, and impactful events such as FTX and team downsizing have unfortunately driven many away. We’ve come to regard some of those who left as friends, and we hope they will return once the situation stabilizes and the prospects look brighter. Meanwhile, we are fully aware the project has lost some for good.

Today, the Star Atlas community is a shadow of what it was two years ago. Even now, as SAGE profitability remains elusive for many, we see faith in the project wavering. It’s not always easy to remain steadfast amid the turmoil, both for the team and for ourselves as a dedicated Star Atlas DAC.

Fortunately, there has always been light at the end of the tunnel—even though some may not have seen it or felt the tunnel was simply too long. At Aephia Industries, we maintain a bird’s-eye view of the project and adopt a long-term perspective. Instead of getting caught up in the daily drama, hype, or silence (lack of new things), we have focused on building and progressing, keeping our sights set on where the team is headed, not just where their products stand today. Still, throughout this period, we have consistently kept people informed, engaged, and thriving within this ecosystem—to the fullest extent possible—every single day!

Aephia Anniversary PFP 2024

Over the past three years, we have been working hard to align Aephia Industries to our founders’ original vision: _to create a Star Atlas-focused, self-governed community of like-minded individuals, offering a gamified layer that envelops Star Atlas, and providing fertile ground for projects that can help push Star Atlas to greater heights_. Our recent management restructuring and Community Expert refresh are testaments to our commitment—not to maintain the status quo but to continually strive for improvement.

## COPA ’24 Winners

In recognition of that unwavering commitment, the team saw fit to award us [**FIRST place**](https://hologramnews.com/aephia-crowned-as-2024-star-atlas-copa-champions/) in the COPA competition earlier this year! The _Council of Peace Assembly_ (COPA) is a competition between DACs (guilds), spanning two rounds. Initially, participating DACs submit a pitch deck, from which the team selects a handful of finalists to present their DAC live during the COPA show. The jury, comprised of team members, evaluates these presentations based on various criteria to determine the winner. For the second-ever COPA event, we came out on top!

While winning is, of course, wonderful, COPA also presents a valuable opportunity to showcase Aephia Industries’ latest achievements and forward-looking plans. It’s an excellent occasion to highlight our ongoing efforts and future initiatives to the community. We highly encourage you to explore our [pitch decks and presentations](https://aephia.com/copa-presentations/)!

## Breakpoint ’23 & ’24

We had a great number of Aephians join the special Community Meetup that took place during Solana’s Breakpoint in Amsterdam last year (a few of them are shown below). All of them (including a number of team members) went home with a limited edition Aephia-hoody.

We look forward to seeing even more of you this year during the _Star Atlas Impact Summit_, which takes place on the 2nd day of Breakpoint in Singapore. We’ll make sure to bring limited edition T-shirts and some other fun trinkets to all Aephians attending! _Make sure to use the dedicated Discord thread to make your presence known beforehand!_

## Celebration

As you’ve likely grown accustomed to, we prefer to spread the festivities concerning our anniversary over several days or even a full week. Each day, we like to share a bit of our knowledge with the community or have some other kind of fun small release. This year is no exception! 

Last year, we [collaborated](https://aephia.com/star-atlas/aephia-industries-dark-core-roasters-enjoy-a-cup-of-aephian-pulse-drive/) with our friends at [Dark Core Roasters](https://darkcoreroasters.com/), offering a special, limited-edition Aephian brew to the community and giving away some for free. We launched a social campaign on top of Never Alone, dubbed _Stronger Together_, and released (members-only) the LitePaper for our NFT campaign: _[AEP Life Form](https://aeplife.io/)_!

Throwback to last year’s (2023) celebrations!

This year, we are going back to our roots and our first-anniversary week, which we dubbed _Knowledge Sharing Week_. The focus is entirely on sharing knowledge through various media. This year, we have _guides_, an _interview with Michael Wagner_, and an _open session on Starbased Automation_. In addition, now that ALF is out of the door, we will focus on another major project we’ve been working on diligently over the past two years: **Cataclysm**!

<YouTube id="TeSExIoueNE" title="Cataclysm: Battle for Iris | Gameplay Teaser"  />
 

We’re going to keep some things under wraps a little longer, but we’re providing the current planning for this week-long celebration below!

Note: _To right away squash any hype/hope, the Cataclysm event is best comparable to our LitePaper launch event last year in scope. So, nope, this is not yet the full release!_

## Anniversary Schedule

We’ve got some great things in store, with a key focus on _sharing knowledge_!

![Aephia Anniversary Schedule 24](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/998ca6208f6288dd29cb464121d6cedb5bccf027d1c36d14bfaf48eda50ecb03.jpg)
