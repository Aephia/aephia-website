After the torrent of news last week, finding newsworthy bits for this week’s issue of our newsletter proved difficult. Thankfully, the team allowed us to share bits and pieces of information from the Foundation Room with you all! This enables us to share some more details regarding the Crew & Ship Component drop and a statement by Michael regarding gameplay.

_Without further ado, let’s jump in!_

Star Atlas – Crew Pack Rarities

## Crew & Component Drop

During the [February 2024 Town Hall](https://aephia.com/star-atlas/town-hall-report-february-27-2024/), Michael announced that ships would be converted into their individual components through an on-chain program instead of a snapshot and a drop.
However, the team has since backtracked on this. Ultimately, the team decided that the additional time investment in building that solution could be better used elsewhere.

The result is that we are now back to plan A: Make a snapshot and airdrop claims for both crew & components into every player’s inventory. The plan is still to drop these simultaneously following the snapshot.

### Placeholder Art

During the aforementioned Town Hall, it also became known that the Crew Cards would be almost exclusively humans (MUD). Due to pressure from the community, the team pivoted to include Crew members from all factions instead. The original reason to go exclusively with MUD was simply that the team is not yet done with all the (character) art for the ONI and Ustur races. Of course, this hasn’t really changed since, though the team is working overtime to book some progress. In the end, however, all ONI and Ustur Crew members will come with art placeholders. These cards will get an update later, updating their art. 

Note that because the Ship Component art is not all done yet either, there will be placeholders used here as well.

### Marketplace

At Crew launch, the Galactic Marketplace won’t yet support the new cNFT standard used for the individual Crew Cards. The team does plan to add this support, but that will go along with a major overhaul. The reason is simple: Crew Cards are (compressed) Non-Fungible Tokens (hence, true NFTs) instead of Semi-Fungible Tokens. This means that any two Crew Cards are not alike, unlike all the ships and other assets that can be found on the Galactic Marketplace today.

Fortunately, the Crew Card’s new cNFT format will be supported by the other popular decentralized NFT exchanges on Solana. This is where trading will take place after launch.

### Brew Updates

During last week’s [Atlas Brew](https://www.youtube.com/live/zLe3N0spdVg?si=T_GqWZ0ho88hFBK5), the team shared a few more details regarding the Crew Cards.

**Aptitudes** – Not all aptitudes are as common as others. The _Command_ aptitude will be rarer than _Flight_, for example.

**Role** – Any crew member can perform any role. Coming with the right matching aptitude will simply increase their XP earning rate.

**Evolving Backgrounds** – The team is looking into updating Crew background over time based on their in-game experiences.

**Tufa/Photoli** – When rolling a super rare anomalous Crew Card, there is a small chance of getting a Tufa or Photoli Crew Card.

**Faction Selection** – When opening Crew Packs, you will (optionally) be able to select a specific faction, _guaranteeing_ that all crew members will be of that specific faction, except for any potential anomalous Tufa or Photoli drops.

**Snapshot** – It does not matter if your ship is in Faction Fleet, SAGE, Starbased, the Galactic Marketplace, or your wallet. The team will be able to figure it all out with that one snapshot.

**Pack Opening** – You can open multiple packs in one go, paying Solana fees only once

**Airdrop Claiming** – You pay rent to claim the Crew Packs, but you’ll get that back when you open them

**SAGE Crew Update** – All ships will respawn back to the CSS (automatically – it looks like) and then Crew will have to be added there to in order to create new fleets and get moving again.

## Gameplay Intent

For those of you active on the Star Atlas Discord, you likely have noticed the pretty heated arguments between some players regarding how the game should be played. This led community member Witticus (aka Jesse) to ask Michael the following question: **Can you please clarify the development team’s intent for gameplay at this stage of development?**

Michael responded with a lengthy answer, which we have included in full below for you all:

> Hey Jesse. Definitely appreciate the kind words, and well reasoned request. This approaches a pretty deep philosophical rabbit hole I’m apprehensive to engage in. We certainly want players of all size and scale to be able to participate in the game. The entire reason we built a pricing model from very small to very large is to accommodate a wide audience of players. Naturally that poses challenges for econ because we have asset values and earnings potential on an exponent curve. Nevertheless, we are in fact aware of these “issues” present for the smaller asset holders, and do have updates on the horizon that should mitigate some of the challenges they’re presently facing. And as we stay the course towards the broader game design, I’d anticipate those problems disappearing. It _is_ just a matter of time.
> 
> Separately, we still have several updates we’re working in to the game, and just need some time to implement them. I think what has become readily apparent is that permanence did not psychologically impact player motivations towards earnings. We understand that most of the “gameplay” today is economic centric. And I in fact want to lean in to that, as it’s a great retention tool to get us into more complex game systems. Give us a bit more time on the proposed change implementation.
> 
> Again, hesitant to comment on the “sniping” issue directly. While we do in fact want everyone to have a sense of camaraderie and collaboration in the progression of their factions, I don’t know that we’ll ever eliminate any one operating in their own best self interest. That’s just kind of basic human nature. To that end, I don’t personally think anyone is “abusing” game systems. There is no exploitation of the way things are “supposed” to work. People are maximizing income, even to the detriment of their own faction. Players will do this in perpetuity. And we can’t be the policing authority over that forever. Part of this path to decentralization is empowering you all to help define the rules. And find ways to productively operate collectively. So as of now, I see no violations of TOS that require us stepping in to enforce. Otherwise, we’ll continue working on game system development so things can balance more towards “fair” opportunities over time

## News Bits

With a week this light on news, we found the below few bits worthy of sharing with you:

* Dan Park is back! He left the company in August of 2023 to pursue an opportunity that aligned well with his interests, but he has now been reinstated as ATMTA’s Legal Counsel.
* Michael was [interviewed](https://x.com/upholdinc/status/1791150528757629391?s=46&t=RK-bKH-sy9Xy2YuOiRlRow) by Frankie Picciano (Global Head of [Topper](https://www.topperpay.com/) Sales). A nice bit of alpha here was Michael sharing that they are considering putting ATMs on their Central Space Stations where players can directly convert their Fiat into ATLAS in-game.
* Gam3s.gg has been showing off a [VZUS solos skin on X](https://x.com/gam3sgg_/status/1790791560625348919?s=46&t=RK-bKH-sy9Xy2YuOiRlRow). It’s not yet clear how this can be obtained, but it stands to reason it will become available after R2.2 has been publicly relaunched.

## Sneak Peeks

Finally, we found some new Rainbow Phi artwork on [Gary Sanchez’s Art Station page](https://www.artstation.com/antarktik) for you!
