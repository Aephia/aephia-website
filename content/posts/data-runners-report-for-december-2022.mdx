The Aephia Data Runners present the monthly report on the economy of Star Atlas regarding adoption, user activity for S.C.O.R.E. & marketplace, trading volume for Ships, Collectibles, Claim Stakes & CSS Land, Star Atlas DAO Treasury, Aephia Ship Price Index, Census over Faction, etc.

### USERS – new faction registrations weekly

• New faction registrations rise in December to over 200 new wallet registration in the last week
• We have to keep in mind that these new registrations might be empty or inactive wallets

Faction registrations are wallets that have registered to one of the three factions. This is
a requirement for playing S.C.O.R.E. We are measuring new registrations within a week.

### USERS – active users in S.C.O.R.E. monthly

• At the end of December 2022 we had 17,800 monthly active users. About 1,000 fewer than the previous month
• In fact, we lost about 3,000 and gained about 2,000 active users
• Weekly active users have dropped to 13k and daily to 8k

Active users in S.C.O.R.E. are wallets that have made at least one transaction (e.g., refill, deposit,
withdrawal) with the S.C.O.R.E. program within a month.

### USERS – active users marketplace & lockers weekly

• During the week of the claim stakes and CSS land sales, we saw activity on the marketplace hit a new ATH with almost 3,000 active users
• Active users for the POLIS and ATLAS locker seem to remain stable at around 1,000 users per week
• In total, we have around 3,000 active users for the marketplace and lockers every week

(blue) marketplace | (orange) POLIS locker | (red) ATLAS locker
Active users on the marketplace are wallets that have at least made one trade in goods on the Star
Atlas marketplace within a week. We excluded resources in this query because the count would then
be very similar to active users in S.C.O.R.E. | Active users for the lockers are wallets that made at least
one transaction with the ATLAS or the POLIS locker within a week.

### LAND – claim stakes & CSS land trading volume daily

• There was almost $1m in claim stakes & CSS land
purchases on the first day
• The trading volume dried up after the first few days
• Claim stakes receive small rewards in S.C.O.R.E. late January and utility in SAGE will come with V1

![](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/58de71fd031706cd244c78d003d1dacaba4901f37dc1370dfd3f60a9a53df350.png)

(blue) claim stakes | (orange) CSS land
This is an aggregate of the ATLAS and USDC trade volumes within one day of the claim stakes & CSS
land on the marketplace, primary and secondary market – measured in USDC.

### SHIPS – star atlas marketplace ship volume daily

• We saw high trading volume in the first days of December when ship discounts were still at 80%
• After that, the daily trading volume in ships leveled off at an average of $20k
• The trading volume in USDC is almost 100% of the total volume

![](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/e5a45f59a65fdf5126b519d3a3ca3beb95d6f46d999cf85e3a515978c4c49454.png)

(blue) ATLAS | (orange) USDC
This is an aggregate of the ATLAS and USDC trade volumes of all ships on the marketplace within
one day – measured in USDC.

### SHIPS – ships staked in S.C.O.R.E.

• Total VWAP of staked ships increased to $165.6m
• As the developer is not selling many ships at the moment, the total VWAP is expected to remain quite stable
• Users unstake ships they want to trade and stake those that aren’t very interesting to trade

![](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/e2351657e5075c9bdb8451e9786828923104dc5e7e63e8d215ed2474b0d8a9b3.png)

Ships staked in SCORE by volume, change in volume within the last month
and VWAP value. The volume weighted average price (VWAP) is the average
origination price (in USDC) weighted by the supply.

### SHIPS – ships staked in S.C.O.R.E.

• Pearce X4 saw a sharp increase in price, so some users unstaked to sell those ships
• The average percentage of ships staked to ships in circulation is stable at 92%

![](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/f859985b8137b318f9a607511a83fadebd9255c3dc398b46ed4709fa1729280e.png)

Ships staked in SCORE by volume, change in volume within the last month
and VWAP value. The volume weighted average price (VWAP) is the average
origination price (in USDC) weighted by the supply.

### DAO – star atlas DAO treasury

• The Star Atlas DAO treasury now holds almost 370M ATLAS and 115k USDC
• The DAO treasury in USDC doubled in the last 4 weeks
• All trades on the marketplace are charged a 6% marketplace fee. 1/3rd of this (2%) goes to the DAO treasury
• At the beginning of December we still had discounted ships and from the December 20th we had the sale for claim stakes and CSS land
• We expect the increase of the DAO treasury to slow down

![](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/64efdb1d5e715b120771c9fb6b54a7e1145ef20299a30c1b263e9f713a8366aa.png)

(blue) income from R4s sold | (orange) income from marketplace fee
The Star Atlas DAO Treasury comes from two sources. First, the R4s sold on the marketplace for
ATLAS go to the DAO treasury. Second, a marketplace fee has been introduced.
⅓ of that fee goes to the DAO treasury.

### ATLAS – ATLAS vs. USDC dominance total trading volume

• ATLAS dominance has dropped to 7%
• Of course, we recognize that after the FTX collapse, ATMTA had to switch to USDC sell pairs to improve their own liquidity situation
• On the other hand, if you only look at the economy, this is not a good position for ATLAS and we hope to see dominance above 50% as soon as possible

(blue) ATLAS | (orange) USDC
We measure the total trading volume for all assets on the Star Atlas
marketplace for ATLAS and USDC. The chart shows the 7 day average
percentage of the total trading volume for ATLAS and USDC.

### SPI – aephia ship price index SPI \[USDC\]

• Unfortunately, there is no point in looking at the
SPI \[ATLAS infl. adj.\] at the moment. For two reasons:
1) ATLAS dominance has dropped to 7%
2) People make too many trading mistakes :(
• We must consider that the SPI \[USDC\] tracks the movement of ship prices and ATLAS/USDC
• Ship prices in USDC are down 50% since August 2022\. Measured in ATLAS, ship prices have risen by 30% over the same period

![](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/33567cb6bfc90098b54a291a0146b48de412f328a2fa791fb8079a2ab38a2014.png)

The Aephia Ship Price Index – SPI (USDC) is a digital asset index tracking the USDC price performance
of all ships available in the Star Atlas metaverse. The index is weighted by the VWAP value of each
ship staked into S.C.O.R.E. Since over 90% of all ships circulating are staked, this is a good approximation
for the circulating market cap. The index starts on July 21, 2022 at a value of 100.

### ACTIVITY – players activity over factions

• Loss of active players: -7% (Mud), -5% (Oni), -6% (Ustur)
• Every faction has 22-23% of inactive players who still have a fleet

![](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/49e1bccccd807180ff3b23f62b409fb4a36f516e9eeade49dffc8db3deec603a.png)

Active players in S.C.O.R.E. are wallets that have made at least one transaction (e.g., refill, deposit,
withdrawal) with the S.C.O.R.E. program within a month. The active and inactive players are divided into the
three factions.

### CENSUS – VWAP over faction

• No major changes in total and Average VWAP MoM
• Median VWAP MOM for active players: +4% (Mud), +6% (Oni), +13% (Ustur)
• Converging median with average of VWAP indigates a smaller gap between high tear (whales) and low tear players

![](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/96855888684e771f96a417e1c6def01db6bc239036187170e5d9c5bc6826d15d.png)

Active players in S.C.O.R.E. are wallets that have made at least one transaction (e.g. refill, deposit, withdrawal) with the
S.C.O.R.E. program within a month. We calculate a mean average and a median across all and across active players.
The volume weighted average price (VWAP) is the average origination price (in USDC) weighted by the supply. Max
VWAP is the player with the highest VWAP of each faction.

### CENSUS – firepower over faction

• Firepower in December calculated with the rules introduced by Sage Manual V2\. Faction gains MoM: 59% (Mud), 58% (Oni), 54% (Ustur)
• Source [here](https://aephia.com/star-atlas-ship-firepower/)

Active players in S.C.O.R.E. are wallets that have made at least one transaction (e.g. refill, deposit,
withdrawal) with the S.C.O.R.E. program within a month. It has been shared in the foundation room discord
channel that the multiplier for component sizes has been changed. The old furmula was “two Small class
components equate to roughly 73,5% of the output of one Medium component”. The new formula is “one medium
component is 2.5x the output of one small component”. If we assume that a missile bay has twice the firepower
of a weapon hardpoint and we set the firepower of an XXS weapon hardpoint to 1, then we can calculate the
firepower for each ship and thus for an entire faction. Max firepower is the player with the highest firepower
of each faction.

### CENSUS – new firepower calculation

of each faction.

### CENSUS – evaluating engagement of player

• Engagement index calculated as ratio between players having more than K VWAP and total players, where K = (100$, 1000$)
• This cohorts rapresents players who consider Star Atlas as seriuos investment.
• Over the months the engagement index is almost constants, meaning that players acquisition and churn kept balance in Q4 2022
