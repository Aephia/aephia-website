Last week started off quietly, but everything changed when the team launched the much-anticipated Golden Carnival on Friday! This exciting, 16-week-long event easily took center stage, and as a result—and lack of other news— this week’s issue is almost entirely dedicated to all things Carnival!

_Let’s dive in!_

Star Atlas – Golden Carnival 2024 – Announcement Banner

## Golden Carnival

The Golden Carnival 2624 is live! The team introduced the ticket crafting recipe this past Friday and published a comprehensive [article](https://medium.com/star-atlas/star-atlas-starts-the-golden-carnival-on-solana-win-your-share-of-the-4-million-lootfest-8c30f07dfb71) to get people up to speed!

This second year, the event will last 16 weeks, from **November 1, 2024**, to **February 21, 2025**, with a weekly drawing each Friday. This means there will be double the number of drawings compared to last year.

So, here’s how it works in a nutshell: There are new **Golden Ticket 2624** assets (SFTs) that can be crafted in-game in _[SAGE Labs: Starbased](https://based.staratlas.com/)_. For the next 16 weeks, every Friday (starting November 8th), a raffle will take place where those who submitted their tickets can win prizes from that week’s prize pool. However, it’s not just a single raffle. A drawing will take place that day for _every_ prize in the pool. Of course, the more tickets you submit, the better your odds of winning!

### 2624 Changes

For this second edition, the team spruced things up a bit in two ways:

* Loot size increased
* Ship manufacturer focus
* Mega weeks

We’ll discuss these further below, but let’s start with the Golden Tickets.

### Golden Tickets

The team has introduced a new crafting recipe into [SAGE Labs: Starbased](https://based.staratlas.com/), resulting in a **Golden Ticket 2624** asset (remember that Star Atlas takes place 600 years into the future).

This recipe is **_only_** available at the Central Space Station of your Faction! The following materials are required to produce a single Golden Ticket:

| **Titanium**             | 230 units |
| ------------------------ | --------- |
| **Toolkits**             | 137 units |
| **Framework**            | 103 units |
| **Electronics**          | 82 units  |
| **Power Source**         | 69 units  |
| **Electromagnet**        | 51 units  |
| **Field Stabilizer**     | 34 units  |
| **Radiation Absorber**   | 26 units  |
| **Particle Accelerator** | 21 units  |

Star Atlas – Golden Ticket 2624 – Recipe

You can craft (and mine the related raw resources) these ingredients yourself, or you can acquire these at the [Galactic Marketplace](https://play.staratlas.com/market/GT24XW4QvPxm1Dj63kYQMVa2nwwReLtcWXyHzA6G4yRw/). The same goes, of course, for the Golden Tickets themselves. You can craft them, or you can buy them. If you craft them, instead of partaking in the raffles, you can also sell your tickets on the [marketplace](https://play.staratlas.com/market/GT24XW4QvPxm1Dj63kYQMVa2nwwReLtcWXyHzA6G4yRw/).

### Submitting your Tickets

Like last year, the team has partnered with the folks from [Hedgehog](https://staratlas.hedgehog.markets/) to facilitate the raffles. Later this week, you can [submit tickets for the raffle](https://staratlas.hedgehog.markets/) that will take place that Friday. You will be able to submit tickets from the moment this platform goes live up to 5 minutes before the drawings begin.

Note that you can submit as many tickets as you want. Every ticket submitted is burned and can not be reclaimed (neither before nor after the raffle).

Starting with week 2, ticket submissions will open up shortly after the previous week concludes (likely on Monday).

### Winning Prizes

The raffles will occur every Friday at 18:00 UTC (10 AM PT / 1 PM ET / 19:00 CET). Each drawing will start with the least expensive item, and every minute, a new raffle will take place for the next most valuable item on the loot table.

**_Update:_** The above was corrected November 11th as the previous description was wrong

### Claiming Prizes

Any winnings must be claimed on the Hedgehog website after that week’s drawing has concluded. You will not automatically receive these! 

### Discord Event

The team will host a [get-together on the Star Atlas Discord](https://discord.com/channels/789226204980707409/1302050412471255103) every Friday, starting 30 minutes before the drawings kick-off. Show up 30 minutes early for minigames that may result in you winning some Golden Tickets!

### Loot Size

This year, the team added 4 million USDC in VWAP prizes to the total loot pool for this event! Note that VWAP means that this is the price at which the team sold/sells these items. It does not reflect the current (often much lower) prices you can find on the marketplace.

### Ship Manufacturer Focus

Instead of adding a random mix of ships and assets to each drawing, the team now sorted these into pools containing ships of one or two manufacturers only. This allows people who’d like a chance to win ships from that manufacturer to consolidate their bets in the respective weeks.

There will be 3 Manufacturer-focused weeks in each 4-week cycle. The manufacturer focus for each of these will be, in order:

* **Pearce & Calico** — These weeks have the most prizes due to the pool having been padded with 130 different crew packs (containing five crew each). Include the 69 ships, and you have a whopping _199 prizes_ that can be won! If you like to win anything, no matter what, these weeks are likely interesting for you!
* **Ogrika & Busan** — An assortment of 91 Busan and Ogrika ships.
* **Fimbul** — This includes the Fimbul, Fimbul BYOS, and Fimbul ECOS ships. The Fimbul BYOS Tankship is the big prize here! There are 99 ships in total and an additional 50 Silver (5) Crew Packs on top for _149 prizes_ that can be won.

### Mega Weeks

There were a few weeks with more loot than others the first time around. This time, the team has made this very clear from the get-go, with clear labeling and visualization. These _Mega Weeks_ will take place every 4th week. Just as important, these weeks will give double the loot of an ordinary week, which makes things very easy to reason about.

The Mega Weeks will all be unique. No two will be the same:

* **Mega Week 1** — The team has defined the loot table for this week (lower right on the picture above).
* **Mega Week 2 & 3** — The community gets to vote on the ships that will be made available for these two weeks, guaranteeing that these will be different from the other Mega Weeks
* **Mega Week 4** — A _Mystery_ Mega Week where the team will surprise us with… something! You’ll have to wait and see. The team’s description reads: “_the unpredictable grand finale, where you’ll have to trust the cosmic currents for the ultimate reward._“

## News Bits

Here are a few more interesting bits to round out this week’s issue:

* Community member _Bodhi_ purchased an anomaly rarity level Tufa Crew Card from another community member for 42 SOL (\~**$23,600**)! This is the most anyone has ever spent on a Crew Card!
* Francesca (Marketing Director) made something cool for Halloween (see the image above)!

_That is it for this week! See you again the next!_
