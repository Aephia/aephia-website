_Welcome to our 22nd newsletter on Star Atlas! This is a weekly newsletter published by Aephia Industries, but that is focused entirely on Star Atlas . Here we try to aggregate all the newsworthy tidbits that were dropped by team members throughout the past week._

## April Fool’s

The team set up a prank over multiple days, suggesting that Santi left the project. During the last townhall, Michael confirmed this notion and stated that Santi left to pursue another job opportunity. Santi jumped on stage right after and seemed about  to confirm this, before revealing that this was all a prank and that he had no plans to go anywhere else.

Aephia also contributed to April 1st, by publishing [an article](https://medium.com/aephia-industries/aephia-industries-acquires-majority-stake-in-atmta-inc-creators-of-star-atlas-ca1dfd1ab6f5) that celebrated them acquiring a majority stake in ATMTA, Inc., the company developing Star Atlas.

## Atlas Star

Last year the team released 4 newsletters, dubbed the “Atlas Star”, without adhering to some sort of (obvious) schedule for publication. The [last issue](https://medium.com/star-atlas/the-atlas-star-newsletter-issue-4-3e13f29900bd) was published quite a while back, on July 15th, 2021.

Now, with the help of Jose (also known as ZeSKK on Discord), the team breathed new life into this newsletter with the release of [a 5th issue](https://medium.com/star-atlas/the-atlas-star-issue-5-60af7ed85101). This issue is less on details but attempts to shed some light on the upcoming DAC gameplay and options in the metaverse. Finally, it ends with a weekly summary of the development progress, supplanting the weekly devblog this week.

## Rosegarden

For a while now we were aware of Project Rosegarden, which promises additional UE5 gameplay and was scheduled to be worked on, after the Showroom would have been released.

This week Michael shed some more light on this project, stating that [Sperasoft](https://sperasoft.com/) will start work on it after the Showroom (dubbed “Volant Studio”) has been finished.

In Rosegarden, we will see the first central space station (there is one at the center of each faction’s security/safe zone) with player habitats and commercial centers. This will be multiplayer enabled and players will be (at least) able to fly around in XXS ships.

When Rosegarden is nearing completion, the team will also look to include experience centers for concerts, art galleries, and museums.

## POLIS

During the townhall Michael clarified that 30% of the future total supply of POLIS was allocated to the team. This allotment will be initially managed at the corporate level but over time a portion of these will be distributed to their team members.

Additionally, 24% of all POLIS has currently been sold to private and public investors (including the TGE/IDO). The remaining POLIS will be rewarded for gameplay (not yet in SCREAM) and participation in the POLIS DAO.

## Game Developers Conference

The Star Atlas team attended the GDC this past week, and Michael (CEO) gave an interstellar presentation about the future of Star Atlas & Gaming.

## Roadmap Updates

The new "Atlas Star" issue contained this week's devblog & roadmap updates, but these can be viewed in their [Notion document](https://staratlas.notion.site/staratlas/72cb710bbd894cd8819bde948e42ac31?v=313101ae608947c9856abad44577194b) as well.

Very little materially changed the past week, so we'll omit going over  the roadmap

## Small Bits

## Translations

The team is looking for people who want to help with translations.
## Ship Pricing

The team recently discussed the repricing of existing ship inventory (vs the current ATLAS/USD value) on an internal call and Michael expects they will implement this soon.
## Faction Passports

Danny confirmed that faction passports are intended to be widely available. However, he added that they may be gated behind reaching a certain point in gameplay progress.
