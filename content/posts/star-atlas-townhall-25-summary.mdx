## **DAO – Governance** 

**This has the highest priority!**

They discovered an issue with determining vote weight:

* People tend to stake multiple times
* People will want to re-stake their POLIS emissions back into the contract
* Knowing people will stake multiple times, the team anticipated difficulties with accurately measuring vote weight. So they are now implementing changes, which will lead to a modest delay.

_Target date: end of February_

There is also a team focussed on global polish.
This is a new division, and their effort will be perpetually ongoing.
Primarily: cleaning up tech debt and taking into account user feedback

Kicked off the development of their own market program.
More intuitive user interface, more gamer-centric approach (think in-game auction houses)
_Target date: Q2 2022_

#### **CREAM**

Major project and subdivided into 3 squads:

* mining & extraction
* crafting & materials
* (new!) space exploration feature (using ships in different ways than just putting them into SCORE)

_Target date: July_

#### **UE5**

A lot of the visuals they shared and will be sharing are subject to change!

#### **4 phases (David) – dev process flow**

* discovery: talk about what the project is, what it should be doing
* exploration: wireframes, prototyping
* validation: use prototypes and community feedback to help the team understand how we use those features
* production

Target dates have been removed from the roadmap.
going forward: Inform on the phase the project is in. Before they release any dates, follow the process of the dev-workflow and then share the confirmed date.

#### **Steven**

150 employees in-house

### **Question responses**

* You are not allowed to use SA assets in any commercial activities, including sales of NFT’s.
* DAC registration is awaiting some more discovery before the team decides what to include. Afterward, more information will be shared with the community.
* Kristian (IA founder) asks Michael for help with reaching out to governments to bring metaverse opportunities to the masses (e.g. education & employment). Michael is supportive of this.
