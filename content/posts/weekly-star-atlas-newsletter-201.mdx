It had been a relatively quiet week in Star Atlas, but the team did unveil a surprising new initiative, _Iris’ Blessing_. This six-month campaign introduces Double XP weekends and monthly raffles worth $5,000\. Meanwhile, DAO voting for PIP 20 & 21 is open for a few more days, fresh INK rewards have been distributed, and preparations are underway for a community meetup in Bangkok during Gamescom Asia!

_Let’s dive in!_

Star Atlas – Iris’ Blessing Campaign Poster

## Iris’ Blessing

The (community) team has kicked off a brand-new, 6-month-long campaign to keep the community engaged with two activities:

1. **Double XP Weekends** — Once a month, earn twice the amount of XP in UE5 while playing the officially designated Gunplay and/or Racing gamemodes. Double XP also means double the amount of INK earned. On top of that, _**soon** the extra XP will also count towards your future z.ink airdrop_!
2. **Monthly Raffles** — On every second Friday of the month, the team will do a raffle where you can win $5k worth of prizes. You’ll have to claim tickets on Discord through the _Sola qint bot_, after which you will automatically participate in the raffles that follow with those tickets.

The double XP weekends speak mostly for themselves, but using the bot and earning tickets is a little more involved. Below, we provide a short _how-to_ to get started:

1. First, go to the [#sola-qint-bot channel](https://discord.com/channels/789226204980707409/1426187684442804235) and click the _Set Wallet_ button. Enter your Solana wallet.
2. Next, go to the [#daily-check-in channel](https://discord.com/channels/789226204980707409/1426807230073929778) to type `!gm`, and then type `/claim` followed by `Iris Blessing`. This should give you 1 and 100 tickets, respectively. Note that, instead of typing `/claim`, you can also use the Claim Code button in the #sola-qint-bot channel.
3. Every day, head back to this last channel and type `!gm`. The number of tickets earned will steadily grow over time.
4. When events take place, such as the Atlas Brew, Economic Forum, or Game Night, a code will be published that you can claim using the `/claim` command.
5. Joining the raffle is fully **automatic**. You do not have to do anything for it.

_Good to know:_ After every raffle, the tickets collected will be **reset** to 0 for the next month. This means everyone starts back from scratch after a raffle concludes.

## DAO Update

There are two PIPs open for voting for a few more days. If you’re a POLIS staker and you haven’t already, consider casting your vote before the deadline this Wednesday (end-of-day).

### PIP-20

[PIP-20: **Establishment of the DAO Casters Program — Elected Content Creators for Star Atlas Ecosystem Promotion**](https://govern.staratlas.com/proposals/159cb743-f8cf-4932-8e01-e6f1a0b479ff) seems to get pretty overwhelming support. Here is the lowdown:

> This proposal introduces the DAO Casters—a structured program of five elected content creators dedicated to promoting the entire Star Atlas ecosystem, including the DAO, the game, and broader community initiatives. DAO Casters will be elected through a formal election process (self-nomination, 1 STV round) as a once-off measure (any further extension of this program would require a new proposal). Each Caster will receive a monthly stipend of 360,000 ATLAS, plus an additional 360,000 ATLAS per month to fund giveaways, contests, and promotions. Caster responsibilities will include weekly content, monthly community livestreams, and regular collaborations. This program provides the ecosystem with consistent, engaging, and professional media representation.

* **Requested funding:** 10.8 million ATLAS over 3 months
* **Structure**: 1-off PIP
* **Author**: Signal
* **Voting Closes**: Wednesday, October 15th (end-of-day UTC)

Current state (\~71M PVP committed):

* **For**: 77.02%
* **Against**: 22.69%
* **Abstain**: 0.28%

### PIP-21

The fate of [PIP-21: **Rogue Data Hub**](https://govern.staratlas.com/proposals/49cad7e4-f467-4c88-978a-e3cac1633cf1) hangs by a thread! The community seems split 50/50 on whether this PIP should be approved. Here are the details:

> We request $8,820 USDC for Year 1 from the DAO treasury to fund the Rogue Data Hub (RDH) — a community-operated Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) product that indexes, processes, and exposes on-chain Star Atlas data. ($2,100 initial, $6,720 yearly maintenance)
> 
> RDH ensures developers, DAOs, and community members have reliable, structured, and real-time data for dashboards, tax reports, visualizations, bots, and decision-support tools.
> 
> * Initial focus: Marketplace token transfers and trades
> * Expansion: All 20 currently active programs listed in the official \[Star Atlas Mainnet Program IDs\] (https://build.staratlas.com/dev-resources/mainnet-program-ids) (starting with only transfer, mint and burn transactions)

* **Requested funding:** 8,820 USDC
* **Structure**: 1-off PIP
* **Author**: Lorddo & Solwalker
* **Voting Closes**: Wednesday, October 15th (end-of-day UTC)

Current state (\~91M PVP committed):

* **For**: 50.60%
* **Against**: 49.38%
* **Abstain**: 0.02%

## News Bits

Before we wrap this issue up, here are a few additional bits of news from last week:

* The second batch of INK Claim airdrops went out last week. If you participated in any of the “official” UE5 matches, head over to your inventory to claim your INK!
* The Z.ink Airdrop campaign testing has started with a few hand-picked community testers. Once that goes well, the team will update us on what’s next.
* Holosim data is being cleaned up (removing alt accounts and those who did some “shady” stuff). Everyone’s main account will remain untouched. But all Alt accounts will be removed from the leaderboard. After this is done, rewards will go out.
* There is a Community meetup taking place on October 18th in Bangkok, Thailand, during _Gamescom Asia_.
