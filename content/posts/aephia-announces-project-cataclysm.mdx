In Project Cataclysm, players will have the opportunity to collect and build decks featuring iconic ships from the Star Atlas universe. Using strategy and clever thinking, players will compete against each other in best-of-three matches to determine the ultimate victor.

As a community project, Cataclysm has been in development for over a year by Aephia, with Valkynen as the developer, Sensei Yamura as the game designer, and Funcracker as the project lead. The team is excited to bring this game to the Star Atlas community and is currently working towards a closed beta release.

To play Cataclysm, players only have to open their browser and log in to find a match. With a focus on strategy and skill, Cataclysm promises to be a thrilling and engaging experience for fans of the Star Atlas universe.
