## Roadmap

The Star Atlas team released their weekly [Roadmap Scan #03](https://medium.com/star-atlas/star-atlas-weekly-development-report-mud-recollection-of-the-past-a3eb0356023e). Below are some of the highlights contained there:

## SCREAM

The team is still busy prototyping. They are testing and refining two prototypes on the blockchain, and have started a third one.

Additionally, they hired a UI Director and a Senior Director of Economy to help with this module.
## Galactic Marketplace

They started building out the ATLAS staking program, while the marketplace program will be submitted for an audit in the coming week.
## POLIS DAO

They onboarded an additional engineer to help with the blockchain program/s and have finalized the reward algorithm details. UX and UI are moving forward as well and it looks like they are approaching the end of the prototype phase.

## Economy

The team is considering adjusting the prices of GAO Wave 2 ships that they sell in ATLAS, in order for these to get back on the same level as the USDC prices.

## Modules & Components

Speaking of ships, Chypto confirmed that ship components and modules are currently manufacturer agnostic and are not locked to any faction. They are universal blueprints that can be unlocked by all players. Each component and module will have a base performance based on its size and quantity. These base performance metrics will then get adjusted by taking into account the ship’s role, size, manufacturer, and price.

Chypto additionally shared that components and modules will be:
- upgradeable (to higher tiers)
- overclockable (akin to enchanting items, like in RPG games)
- mod slottable (like inserting an “upgrade chip”, akin to inserting gems into items in the Diablo games).

## Character Customization

Danny confirmed that they will be utilizing the [MetaHuman creator of Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/metahuman-creator) to generate their characters.Though this technology is mostly known for creating hyper-realistic “humans”, according to Danny it can also be used to create aliens.

## Roadshow

Two weeks ago, a few members of the team were present at NFT LA, where they hosted some cool events. Last week Michael (CEO), Pablo (CRO) and others have been attending the Solana Hackerhouse in Miami, where they hosted a panel on “[The Genesis of the Metaverse](https://twitter.com/staratlas/status/1512164972943474706)”.
