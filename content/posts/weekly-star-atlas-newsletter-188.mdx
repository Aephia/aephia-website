The past week was very light on news. The only real news, which even flew mostly under the radar, is that the Holosim beta period is wrapping up soon. Furthermore, we got an _announcement of an announcement_! Other than that, the Community Week preparations are well underway, and the PIP-18 is open for voting for a few more days!

_Let’s dive in!_

## Announcement of an Announcement

Due to a lack of news, an announcement of an announcement is making the headline item this week!

Michael shared the following on X on Wednesday of last week:

<XTweet id="1942777183568814206" url="https://twitter.com/at_mwagner/status/1942777183568814206" authorName="SW4GN3R, CFA" authorHandle="@at_mwagner" date="2025-07-09">
Something monumental coming for Star Atlas. Consider this your announcement of an announcement.
</XTweet>
 

This was followed up on, on Sunday (US time), with the following message:

<XTweet id="1944592222672081175" url="https://twitter.com/at_mwagner/status/1944592222672081175" authorName="SW4GN3R, CFA" authorHandle="@at_mwagner" date="2025-07-14">
Tomorrow. Big day. Perfectly timed with the start of the real bull. Magnificent.
</XTweet>
 

All in all, it appears that the team will make a monumental announcement later today. Stay tuned!

## Holosim

The team shared last week that the beta period of Holosim is coming to an end on July 31st. It looks like the game will then coast for a bit afterward, without further (quest) updates. It will remain available, however, while the team processes the feedback and prepares to launch Holosim with Season 1 officially.

On the topic of feedback: If you’ve recently played Holosim, the team is seeking your feedback. To gather your thoughts and insights, they have [published a form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScRBaeruoWqLEXgYsNZ1uqHrSoLMAtpQ2UGTiDKaqjV7gCMyQ/viewform?fbzx=-5744843827124686341) for you to fill out.

## Community Week

The deadline for [Joni Award nominations](https://forms.gle/CjYYvxU6Bn7g5ex99) is this **Thursday, July 17th**. The deadline for COPA submissions is the **same day**.

Make sure not to miss it, and cast your vote today! Be aware that the Joni Awards form asks for some argumentation as to why you made that choice, meaning it likely will take a little time to fill it out.
