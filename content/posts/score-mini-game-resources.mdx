Responding to a question about resources in the Star Atlas Foundation channel, Star Atlas CEO, Michael Wagner, confirmed that:

Max capacity of resources will scale to the size of the fleet. However, consumption time will remain the same, as every ship within a fleet maintains the same consumption rate.

Factions are not relevant to ships at this time. However, players will need to have selected a faction to participate.
