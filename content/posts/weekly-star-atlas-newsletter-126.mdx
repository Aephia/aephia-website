Last week was a big week, with the long-anticipated multiplayer stress test taking place, major Starbased changes dropping, and the unexpected announcement of ATMTA acquiring the former company of the three co-founders, Multichain Ventures. As part of that announcement, we’ve also learned that soon, a new asset class will become available: Cultivation Facilities. And, one would almost forget, a new DataRunner ship has been released, the Fimbul BYOS Ranger!

_Let’s dive in!_

![Screenshot 2024 04 21 at 17.02.07](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/44f3e9baaee2b9e0a5bafba94f43b30b689c875f0869f1cf62a9c17c14aaf89d.png)

## Multichain Ventures Acquisition

In a surprise [announcement](https://medium.com/star-atlas/a-metaverse-in-expansion-star-atlas-acquires-assets-and-intellectual-property-from-multichain-597c5f4d7f2c) on April 20th (4/20), at 4:20 AM PT, the team announced the acquisition of Multichain Ventures (MV), the company Michael co-founded prior to Star Atlas. This incorporation happened without any money being transferred between the two companies.

With the acquisition, the team adopts a small revenue stream (\~$500k/year) from a licensing deal made late last year. Most important to Michael, however, is that this acquisition allows him to finally close the books on his old company, and allows him to focus fully on Star Atlas.

As some will know, Star Atlas was really born from within Multichain Ventures in the second half of 2020, when some doors (opportunities) closed, and the company’s outlook grew grim. Unfortunately, the team had already completed their ICO, selling tokens to the public. In addition, they used a considerable amount of their Tokes (TKS) token to pay for services as well.

In short, Michael and other MV employees starting a new company and shifting their focus, while MV was struggling, resulted in some Tokes holders feeling rugged. Feeling a responsibility to those who believed in them, Danny (CPO), Jacob (CTO), and Michael have been envisioning the integration of MV into ATMTA from the moment they started conceptualizing Star Atlas. However, they kept this to themselves, as at that point in time, there was no guarantee that ATMTA would ever be able to accomplish this.

Now, after Tokes holders have been waiting for nearly 4 years with little hope or expectation that their tokens would ever regain some of their former value, the team is finally in a position to complete the integration and make Tokes holders whole.

> On a personal and reputational level, I do think it’s important to demonstrate that myself and our other founders are not in the business of launching tokens and abandoning them. This has been a criticism/accusation I’ve seen a number of times. That’s not who I am. I think this move, combined with our fortitude through the bear market, truly showcases what we’re all about.
> 
> \[…\] I do feel it’s important to deliver value to people who have supported me for 7+ years. As I would want to do with SA should anything catastrophic ever happen here.
> 
> Michael (CEO)

> \[…\] it feels good to get this done personally. I’m in a position now to fully wind down Multichain ventures. Don’t have to think about it ever again after this.
> 
> Michael (CEO)

### The Plan for $TKS (Tokes)

The team is introducing a brand new asset category (see next section!) that will be exclusively available to the owner of the Tokes token for the first six months. Of course, once this token is bridged, it will likely become possible to acquire it from current holders.

To facilitate this, Jacob has been working on a bridge to migrate the Tokes token from Wave (the L1 chain they are on) to Solana. In addition, the team added support for Tokes to the Galactic Marketplace.

The team is keeping the supply of the new assets limited to Tokes holders because they are unsure how many holders will redeem their tokens. After 6 months, they feel that Tokes holders have gotten their fair chance to swap their tokens for the new assets, after which they will make the remaining assets available for USDC/ATLAS. The team is consciously not opening access to SA users right away, as this could result in them not having enough left for all Tokes holders to redeem. 

Note that the team’s goal is to minimize the quantities of these cultivation facilities released. In other words, if many Tokes holders redeem their tokens, there may not be much supply left.

As for Tokes, the redemption program is temporary, and every token the team receives is getting burned. Afterward, the Tokes token will be fully deprecated. In other words, this is a one-time deal for Tokes holders to convert their tokens before they lose all value.

### Concerns

Unsurprisingly, the community scrutinized the announcement, with some spending hours venting their concerns on the Star Atlas Discord. Michael responded to some of these, and we’ve tried to summarize some of what he shared below.

First, all Tokes tokens that remained in the MV treasury have been burned. This includes most of the team’s allocation (the part not yet distributed). The only tokens that will be redeemed are in individuals’ hands. Put in numbers, 1 billion tokens were minted, and \~670 million of these have been burned. This means that \~330 million remain.

Of these 330 million tokens, Michael estimates that at most 2-3% are in the hands of MV employees (including the ATMTA founders). Like ATMTA’s treasury, MV held the largest chunk of the team’s allocation for later distribution. This has now been burned.

Second, to minimize the impact on existing production and holders, the team went with a new asset class that generates (primarily) new resources. If Tokes holders redeem and then dump their assets (as _exit liquidity_), the value of these items is up to the community to decide. There is no (price) history there yet.

Lastly, some community members are concerned about dilution, but of course, dilution is happening non-stop (e.g., through releasing new ships) and would have happened anyway as the team would have sold these assets regardless.

## Cultivation Facilities

If you’ve been around for a while, it likely won’t come as a surprise, but the team has had plans for agricultural assets for a good few years now. For example, the above concept art was published roughly two years ago.

As part of their merger announcement with Multichain Ventures (see previous section), the team has now _pre_\-announced the upcoming sale of _Cultivation Facilities_ on their marketplace.

> From the announcement:
> These facilities will enable the cultivation of plants utilized to produce various substances, including stims, medicines, and psychotropics. These substances will have diverse effects on crew member performance, both beneficial and detrimental.

The tier, quantity, and price (in Tokes!) of these can be found in the table below:

| Cultivation Facility | Quantity | Tokes Token |
| -------------------- | -------- | ----------- |
| Tier 1               | 17 333   | 2 000       |
| Tier 2               | 5 475    | 6 632       |
| Tier 3               | 1 327    | 26 130      |
| Tier 4               | 232      | 149 402     |
| Tier 5               | 27       | 1 275 619   |

Similar to Claim Stakes, these will not yet play a role in Star Atlas UE5 and/or SAGE. Instead, the team will modify the Faction Claims program (a light lift, according to Michael), allowing owners to stake these assets there and enjoy a passive stream of various assets.

Most prominently, a new resource type will be emitted in the form of exotic plants, which are required, among other things(?), for stim packs for crew members.

A small part of the emissions will be Biomass and Carbon. The added production of these resources should not affect the overall emissions too much. Michael shared that Biomass will likely only make up something like 5% of the total production value of raw materials of those facilities.

Star Atlas – Surge

## Multiplayer “Surge” Stress Test

The much-anticipated second Multiplayer Stress Test took place this past weekend! The team organized two three-hour sessions of multiplayer Surge gameplay in hopes of reaching the 1000-player milestone.

They succeeded, as during the 4th Surge match, the counter hit 1060 players! Playing the game was pretty hard at that point, with lag, freezing, and stuttering, making it difficult to move around, let alone shoot someone. After the player count went down to about 500, the game became more fun to play again.

Fewer people participated in the second session, ensuring that most of them had a good time with relatively smooth gameplay.

### Crew Card Reward

The team promised to reward all active participants with an unspecified amount of ATLAS and a Crew Card. The rarity of the card was dependent on the amount of concurrently active players. As we breached 1000 players, all participants will receive a rare Crew Card!

The card’s faction depended on which faction had the most wins by the time the 1000-player count was achieved. At that point in time, Ustur had the most wins, so the expectation is that every participant will get a rare Ustur Crew Card. However, the team has not yet officially announced the exact reward.

Star Atlas – Surge Crew \[Tier 3\]

## Starbased Changes

Originally, the team planned to tweak quite a bit of Starbased’s gameplay and economy on April 16th. In the end, however, the team decided not to move forward with the big economic change that would see a restructuring and deepening of the LP to ATLAS mechanics for all three factions. They realized their suggested solution needed more work.

The remaining changes were not rolled out on the 16th of April but in the late evening of the 17th. More changes followed on the 18th and 19th. Below, we discuss all of these.

### Crafting Recipe Updates

A minor but important update was rolled out first: _Framework 2_ and _Toolkits 2_ now require 1 steel, where they previously required 2.

### Upkeep

Late last Wednesday, the team tweaked some numbers used to determine the Upkeep rate for a Starbase. In short, the burn rate of _Food_ at a _Tier 1 Starbase_ has been reduced by 33%. Along with it, the maximum amount of Food that can be supplied to this Upkeep process has also been lowered to ensure that only 12 hours’ worth of Food can be provided.

Instead of lowering the higher Tier Starbase burn rates by 33% as well, the team reduced these significantly further! This does not only apply to Food! The Toolkit burn rates for Tier 2+ Starbases have also been reduced. For a full overview of the new values, check out our [Starbased guide](https://aephia.com/star-atlas/starbased-the-missing-manual/), which we’ve updated with the new numbers.

This effect had the biggest impact on the CSS, a Tier 6 Starbase. Where previously the burn rate of Food was 927 per second, it is now 361 per second, a 61% reduction!

### SDU Overhaul

The SDU Mechanics have finally been updated! Ships have been assigned three new stats, which can all be found in Chip’s [Ship Stats spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cfzW3uiqkbnfJexBysh0MAzZYRhiRwQg8WlsFWfuKgs/edit#gid=205337066):

* SDU/Scan – Maximum number of SDUs that can be found per scan. If you have multiple ships within a fleet, you can add these numbers up.
* Food/Scan – Amount of food spent per scan. You can add these numbers up if you have multiple ships within a fleet.
* Scan Cooldown – For a fleet, the longest cooldown is applied.

Previously, every tile had a percentage _chance_ attached to it, which would change with time (and scans). In the new scanning game, this has been replaced by a new property called _**Information Density**_. This property (still a percentage) is a measure of the SDU _Information Density_. Simply put, a density of 1% means there are 10 SDUs to be found here, 2% means 20 SDUs, etc.

If there are 20 SDUs available on a tile, a scan will not find more than 20 SDUs, regardless of a ship’s SDU/Scan rate. The theoretical maximum amount of SDUs found on a tile is 1000, as that would constitute an _Information Density_ of 100%. This means that Titan ships can not, at present, scan very efficiently with their &gt;8000 SDU/Scan rate. But in reality, any ship that is capital or bigger will struggle to make the best use of its scanning rate.

Alongside the above changes, the _global SDU per minute ceiling was removed_.

With this change, Data Runner ships now excel at scanning, as their SDU/Scan rate is considerably higher than other ships in their size class while scanning also costs them _no_ food.

### Loyalty Points

On Thursday, the 18th, the team made a few more tweaks, this time to the Loyalty Points that can be earned through providing Food and Toolkits to a Starbase’s Upkeep.

Before the change, 1 Food would reward 1 LP. Now, this is 3 LP instead, a 200% increase! Toolkits also went up! Where before, 1 Toolkit would reward 3 LP, this now has doubled to 6 LP!

These changes should make it _more_ worthwhile to supply both Food and Toolkits to the Upkeep process.

### Hot Wallet

Last Friday, the team launched its hot-wallet feature in Starbased. This feature allows anyone to play the game while greatly reducing the number of interruptions caused by transactions that need to be signed.

To activate this feature, first enable ATLAS Prime in the new Transaction and Settings menu. Then, move some of your ATLAS to the ATLAS Vault.

![Screenshot 2024 04 22 at 18.27.05](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/c9090ee35e872a7f1dd12ab8b447f9d240d58eca226eeb87d41abddd891e5308.png)

SAGE Starbases – Hot Wallet Enabled!

Lastly, enable the Hot Wallet and jump into the Advanced Hot Wallet Settings to enable the transaction types for which you’d like to forgo signing transactions.

You may notice a number of other changes and improvements. There is also a SOL Vault, which will be filled with Solana when rent accounts are cleaned up. When SOL is present there, it will be used for the next transaction’s fee instead of the Prime program having to first convert ATLAS. This means you will not pay the team’s additional fee (10%) on that specific transaction. In the near future, it should be possible to move some SOL to that vault manually, which means you can skip the conversion program altogether and save the fee currently spent on ATLAS-to-SOL conversion.

## New Ship: Fimbul BYOS Ranger

Late Monday last week, the team introduced a brand new Medium-sized ship on the Marketplace, the [Fimbul BYOS Ranger](https://play.staratlas.com/market/RNGRjeGyFeyFT4k5aTJXKZukVx3GbG215fcSQJxg64G/).

This Data Runner has a total supply of 3,313, of which the first tranche is currently available at a 25% discount for 2,096 USDC, or 378,521 ATLAS.

Interestingly, that makes it more expensive than the VZUS opod, another medium Data Runner from the first GAO wave. The stats between these are nearly the same. The _Ranger_ has a slight edge in cargo space, while the _opod_ can carry a little more fuel.

> ‘Information is worth double its costs in ATLAS’ (Lesson Number 84 of The Most Successful Guide of Common Sense Learnings for the Benefit of Space Exploration). Post-Convergence War, the Medium Risk Zone has never been more unpredictable. But fear not, captain! The Ranger, Fimbul’s groundbreaking medium data runner ship, is designed for those who navigate the galaxy’s dangers with wisdom and speed. It’s the industry’s most affordable data runner in its class, equipped for rapid scanning and swift evasion, ensuring you’re always one step ahead of cosmic threats. With the Ranger, you invest not just in a ship but in the safety and success of your fleet. Its unmatched scanning speed and agility make it a must-have for any captain aiming to conquer the unknown without risking it all. Join the smart navigators turning challenges into opportunities. Secure your Ranger today, and sail the stars with confidence!

## News Bits

Faction Fleet rewards are still being emitted. Though the team originally planned to shut these down along with the old SAGE Labs emissions being turned off, this has so far not yet happened. It’s unclear when the emissions for Faction Fleet will shut down.

Meanwhile, as mentioned, the old SAGE Labs build no longer emits resources for mining or SDUs for scanning. All the crafting recipes have become unavailable as well. Active crafting processes are allowed to run their course, but otherwise, there is nothing left to do but pull everything out and move them to Starbased.

Lastly, on the 15th of April, the team did another ATLAS rebase of their assets on the Galactic Marketplace. Due to ATLAS having lost a good amount of value during the weekend before, many assets were available at a steep discount. The rebase sorted that and also lowered the Fimbul Airbike price from its 20 USD equivalent to 15 USD.
