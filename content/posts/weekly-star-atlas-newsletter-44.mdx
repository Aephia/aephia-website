_Welcome to our 44th newsletter on Star Atlas! This is a weekly newsletter, published by Aephia Industries, that is focused entirely on Star Atlas. Here we try to aggregate all the newsworthy tidbits that were dropped by the team throughout the past week_

We had another quiet week in Star Atlas development, with not much new info being shared by the team. The lore team did, as always, share their [Roadmap Scan (#18)](https://medium.com/star-atlas/the-truth-about-gerio-part-iii-star-atlas-roadmap-scan-18-6b25cbcab4ab) however, shedding more light on the mysterious origins of the creature Atoph.

## Star Atlas DAO

The team spent the pst week fixing  some bugs in the ATLAS Locker that were discovered earlier. The plan is to wrap that up this week.

Perhaps more exciting is that development is on-going on a dark mode for the DAO portal and the creation and publication of developer tools to interact with the POLIS-, and (upcoming) ATLAS Lockers.

Lastly the product design team is working on the design for Proposals.

## SCREAM

The blockchain team has started working on the Starbase crafting program and on Fleet Configuration. They also have been working on the Hangar system. Ship escrowing has reportedly been completed!

Meanwhile, the economics team shared that they have started modeling of the XP system.

Finally the web-team has continued work on “Outliner” and has also started work on combat functionality. Additionally they have been busy updating the camera views and controls, while also updating the movement logic and user experience.

## Other Progress

- The Volant Studio Showroom R1 is done and the team continues to work on its distribution.
- Work is being done to finish the first few issues of the upcoming Graphic Novel, while the team is also still working on that product’s distribution.
- The Marketplace Royalty Fee program has been deployed to devnet and testing is underway. Logic for fee reductions has been implemented.

Finally, the team has been working on various bug fixes & quality of live improvements for the Galactic Marketplace, including:
- The address that sells the R4 is now represented as “Star Atlas DAO”.
- Some sell orders could not be cancelled - Fixed
- Enable click to copy buyer/seller address

## Ships

In an interesting turn of events, despite an earlier announcement, no ship was released last week. The original tweet -announcing the upcoming arrival of an insect-like looking ship- has since been deleted.

No new ship was announced last week and it is unclear when the next ship will be released.

## Education
