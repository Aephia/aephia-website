## Introduction

Welcome to our first newsletter! The goal of this newsletter is to share the most newsworthy information that was released by the Star Atlas team over the past week. We extracted this from interviews, townhall meetings, articles & the Discord chat, so you won’t have to!

## Announcements

Star Atlas kicked things off with a [Tweet](https://twitter.com/staratlas/status/1444038526828310528) signaling the long awaited faction selection, a mini-game trailer, and new ships for the [GAO](https://staratlas.com/gao-brochure.pdf). After a few hours, the tweet was followed by a [Medium article](https://medium.com/star-atlas/october-star-atlas-release-player-factions-trailer-ships-cce89bcb6a9f) containing more information and a schedule. This Tuesday, October 5 at 10 AM EDT, phase one of the mini-game will be available to all players. This includes profile creation, faction selection, and guild recruitment. Next, on Wednesday, October 6 at 9 AM EDT, a gameplay trailer will premiere on YouTube. Lastly, on Thursday October 7 at 10 AM and 11 AM respectively, two new ships will be made available for purchase in the GAO. They then wrapped this off by releasing another [article explaining land](https://medium.com/star-atlas/star-atlas-in-game-land-landowner-63f9bd789027) and the different mechanics that it offers. Make sure to [retweet](https://twitter.com/staratlas/status/1444038526828310528?s=20) for a chance to win a Pearce X4!

## Assets

After the successful GAO and [FIRMAM3NTAL](https://medium.com/star-atlas/firmam3ntal-star-makers-digital-fashion-collection-star-atlas-the-fabricant-f95b87d1c34) releases, players have been wondering about licenses. The team confirmed that licenses are not expensive and these are bound to your account along with passports and skills progression. As for badges that were part of the ReBirth airdrop, these are considered as NFTs. Speaking of the ReBirth airdrop, vanity and cosmetic items such as skins, charms, and emotes currently do not have utility in the mini-game but may serve a purpose in the future.

## Gameplay

The team has decided to reduce the depth of the mini-game that will soon be playable to allow players to start earning. They also confirmed that there is no limit on the number of ships that players can control so you can maximize the utility of all assets that you own. Owners of multiple ships can choose to buy their corresponding licenses or (in the future) enroll in flying school to earn them instead. Rewards from the mini-game will be in the form of ATLAS but may also have NFTs. Ship mission tiers will determine the quality of the rewards.

## Tokens

[Gate.io](https://www.gate.io/) now has POLIS listed on their website while [Okcoin.com](https://www.okcoin.com/) has both ATLAS and POLIS. You can now trade your tokens here alongside [FTX.com](https://ftx.com/).
