The Star Atlas _Social Campaign_ “Never Alone” has launched! In this guide, we will go over everything you need to know to get going and (hopefully) make the right choices.

> “This is a neuro scanner, and it will show you the progress on recovering the Punaab’s memories. As you can see now, there is barely any progress, but as you expose him to different environments and tasks, hopefully, you will see the memory gauge filling up to the point where major events of his past will return to him.”

Saand the Punaab standing in front of his crashed ship

## Background

On May 10th, the team kicked things off stealthily by sharing the [background story](https://medium.com/star-atlas/prelude-a-galaxy-in-movement-the-first-day-e3c716b1ecde) for the event. In this story, the two core ingredients for the campaign were introduced:

1. The Saand Punaab character, how you (the adventurer in the story) two met, and your objective (return his memory)
2. The Council of Peace (CoP) changing its stance from passive to active/aggressive regarding the ECOS and Jorvik. Where previously, they allowed these minor (pirate) factions to exist outside of the Safe/Secure Zone without any interference from the CoP, after a bunch of brutal incursions, this has now come to an end. The Council of Peace is going to war!

The story combines the two threads, by suggesting that you can contribute to both objectives in one go. By helping the Council wage war on the pirate factions, and bringing Saand while doing so, the events you two will experience may jog his memory and allow him to recover some of his memories.

On May 11th, the team followed up by [launching](https://medium.com/star-atlas/never-alone-a-shared-social-adventure-across-the-star-atlas-galaxy-89cd90627234) the actual campaign, which ties directly into this lore.

## Mission Dashboard

The Campaign is run through an online engagement tool called [Zealy](https://zealy.io/c/staratlas-never-alone/questboard) (formerly known as [Crew3](https://zealy.notion.site/Crew3-is-now-Zealy-d1b2193e3a954b85a0845d4a41472b40)). The team defined a whole bunch of quests in Zealy, and when you go there, you will simply see a mission dashboard, containing those quests, waiting for you to engage with them. Most of these you can easily complete through links in the quests or by providing an answer to a question (both lore & personal info like Twitter profile & wallet). However, there are also quests that require you to use the supplied wallet to engage with other applications the team will launch this year. For this first Mission, the focus lies on Escape Velocity!

## Missions

Never Alone consist of 4 chapters, or missions. Each mission will have its own quests and lore and is crafted around a product the Star Atlas will launch this year. This does not mean that all the quests for that mission will be solely focused on that product, there will be plenty of more general quests introduced with each mission.

### Quests

Each mission consists of a number of (chains of ) quests. In order to complete any of them, you will first have to have completed prerequisite quests. Mission 1 starts with a single quest in the Intro category that has to be completed before other quests and other categories become available.

Each quest comes with a small snippet of lore to describe what is happening. Completing a quest requires you to answer a multiple-choice question, an open question (which will trigger a review), a social-media action (Twitter), or a Discord action (claiming role). The first mission, another mechanic is moving ships around in Escape Velocity.

Straight-up multiple-choice quiz questions and social media engagement (like/RT) will be verified on the spot. However, when it comes to open-ended questions (like your Solana wallet – the very first quest), or posting specific content on Twitter/YouTube, your answer will need to be reviewed by a member of the team. This may take a while, so best to plan for that.

The quests are divided into multiple categories, each one containing one or several quest chains. For the first mission, these are:

* Intro
* Diplomacy
* Exploration
* Research
* Mission 1 – Escape Velocity

### Mission I

The very first mission, Scraps & Spoils, launched on May 11th, and will run for a total of 60 days. This means the last day should be July 10th. You can check the time remaining on the [official web page](https://www.staratlas.com/campaigns/never-alone). 

Interestingly, _you will still be able to complete quests after Mission 1 has officially ended_. However, the [official FAQ article](https://support.staratlas.com/can-i-continue-getting-loot-after-mission-one) does caution that you won’t be able to acquire Tier 3 memories anymore, because some of the quests are time sensitive, and will have come to an end. Knowing Escape Velocity will only have a limited run before it goes offline, this is likely what the entry is referring to.

Besides general quests, this mission comes with intro quests to set everything up and mission-specific quests focused on Escape Velocity.

In addition to the quests that you can already find on Zealy (list below), **there will also be quests introduced as the campaign progresses**. This means that you won’t have to complete all quests to earn the Memory Revelation for this mission!

2 time-limited quest; introduced after the launch of the Never Alone campaign

## Memories

Once you have gathered enough XP points, you will be able to redeem these for Memories The more XP, the higher the tier of this Memory.

![Never Alone - The three different Memory Tiers](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/c5b463ac37eb1106b79ee48eed10014dd8df2cc277f0dc6ec9dbbfd284ab74b5.png)

Never Alone – The three different Memory Tiers

Below is an overview of the various tiers and the amount of XP needed to acquire them:

* Memory Glimpse: **5000 XP**
* Memory Fragment: **6250 XP**
* Memory Revelation: **7500 XP**

When you accumulate 5000 XP, you can finish the “Recover a Memory Glimpse” quest. You will need to supply the wallet where you want to receive the SFT. 

Next, when you hit 6250 XP, you can complete the “Recover a Memory Fragment, and so on. Completing all three quests (meaning you accumulated at least 7500 XP) will deliver you all three SFTs into your wallet. 

To make this ultra clear: **You can get all three Memory SFTs**! It’s not a single one that somehow gets upgraded, it’s really three different assets. This is important when looking at the Utility (or shall we say: Loot!) next.

**Important:** _You will be able to accumulate 10000 XP in Mission 1, which means you won’t have to finish each and every quest!_

### Loot! 

The Memories you unlock (acquire) can be used in one of three ways:

* You can sell them on the Galactic Marketplace, to people who want to use them for the other two options:
* You can redeem a memory for Mission-specific rewards
* You can collect a set of three same-tier memories and redeem the set to receive an asset bundle

This last option also contributes points to your DAC, enabling them to potentially win some awesome guild-specific loot for their treasury!

Let’s dive deeper into the last two options!

### Mission Specific Rewards

There are 4 missions, or story arcs, in the Never Alone campaign, and each one will offer you interesting rewards in exchange for the memories you manage to collect. Each individual memory can be exchanged for a specific piece of loot, offered for that specific mission.

For Mission 1, you can exchange the memories for the following rewards:

1. **Memory Glimpse**: Exclusive character skin
2. **Memory Fragment**: VZUS solos (XXS ship)
3. **Memory Revelation**: Exclusive VZUS solos skin

![Never Alone - Mission 1 rewards](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/24d251c63c3c8d822992dc41919f3a4721f4094b8246296247c57323d5da509c.png)

Never Alone – Mission 1 rewards

When you redeem a memory, that memory is burned, meaning you can only use them once. For Mission 2, 3, and 4, the team will introduce new rewards!

Note: _You will only be able to exchange memories for loot after the end of the second mission! At that point, there will be a web page available where you can exchange these memories._

### Saand’s Story Rewards

An alternate route you can take is trying to earn memories in at least 3 of the 4 missions. When you gather, and hold 3 memories of the same tier (i.e. all three are either _Glimpses_, _Fragments_, or _Revelations_) until the end of the year, you can instead exchange such sets for a complete Saand Story digital asset bundle on the Never Alone Campaign page, effectively allowing you to complete the main quest.

The rewards for these sets are:

* **Glimpses of a Forgotten Life**  
Hand in **3 _Memory_ _Glimpses_** to receive:  
– [Fimbul ECOS Unibomba](https://play.staratlas.com/market/9zrgra3XQkZPt8XNs4fowbqmj7B8bBx76aEmsKSnm9BW/) (XXS ship)  
– Ship Component Upgrade Bundle (Tier 0 -&gt; Tier 1)  
– Glimpses of a Forgotten Life _title_ (account bound)
* **Fragments of a Forgotten Life**  
Hand in ****3 _Memory_ _Fragments_** to receive:  
– [Calico Maxhog](https://play.staratlas.com/market/GxpbUDxYYvxiUejHcAMzeV2rzdHf6KZZvT86ACrpFgXa/) (XS ship)[  
](https://play.staratlas.com/market/GxpbUDxYYvxiUejHcAMzeV2rzdHf6KZZvT86ACrpFgXa/)– Ship Component Upgrade Bundle (Tier 0 -&gt; Tier 1)  
– Foundation Room access (account bound)  
– Fragments of a Forgotten Life _title_ (account bound)
* **Revelations of a Forgotten Life**  
Hand in ****3 _Memory_ _Revelations_** to receive:  
– [Ogrika Niruch](https://play.staratlas.com/market/7SUoWHWWJCxCe5g9XqZkCRufGHXRV8nauuz69HPjuewr/) (XS ship)  
– Ship Component Upgrade Bundle (Tier 0 -&gt; Tier 2)  
– Saand Crewmember  
– Foundation Room access (account bound)  
– Revelations of a Forgotten Life _title_ (account bound)

### Ship Component Upgrade Bundle

The Ship Component Upgrade Bundles listed above will each come with an upgrade to three main components of your ships:

* Thrusters
* Shields
* Weapons

These bundles will only be usable on ships _of the same size_ as the one you are receiving in the asset bundle. As an example, you can apply the _Glimpses of a Forgotten Life_ only to an XXS ship. By doing so, the three components will be upgraded from **Tier 0** (the default) to **Tier 1**.

### Support your DAC

There is one more important aspect to saving your Memories until the end of the year. By exchanging a set of three same-tier memories, you can actually help out your DAC. Let’s dive into that next!

![Never Alone - End of Year reward bundles](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/c808750ed0a610fca3b62f1ad997f382760bd8480cbbe4f8f46deba842cb4bd4.webp)

Never Alone – End of Year reward bundles

## DAC Competition

There is a whole second layer to this Campaign, and that focuses exclusively on Decentralized Autonomous Corporations, or DACs (more widely known as _guilds_). Every DAC member that redeems 3 memories of the same tier at the end of the year, will also contribute points to their DAC. The more points a DAC gets, the higher their score and the better their chance to win some reward(s) for their guild.

Each tier of memories redeemed is worth a different amount of points. If you redeem multiple, then you will get multiple asset bundles (see previous section), and your DAC will accumulate more points.

![Never Alone - DAC Point Contribution](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/e03e08e22a084a36aff12860b7a097dc8551979696f047d70f800eae63f357ef.png)

Never Alone – DAC Point Contribution

Here is the overview of the points each tier is worth:

* If you handed in **3 _Memory_ _Glimpses_** – 10 points
* If you handed in ****3 _Memory_ _Fragments_** – 15 points
* If you handed in ****3 _Memory_ _Revelations_** – 25 points

If you complete all quests and keep all your Memories until the end, you can contribute a whopping 50 points to your DAC (and get all three asset bundles)!

There will be several pools of DACs, assuring smaller DACs also have a chance to bring home some loot!

### Loot Pool

The Loot available to DACs is impressive. The grand prize will be a _Tier 5 Central Space Station Land/Hab_ ($1.7 million VWAP – Winner decides which Faction they want it to be located in). The other prizes are listed in the infographic below:

![DAC Loot Pool](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/194452c2be0a0c4af1f434897cb91950ed13e82af050999781fa1edbe89da5b6.png)

Never Alone – DAC Loot Pool

## Social Experiment

The [official Medium article](http://Never Alone: A Shared Social Adventure Across the Star Atlas Galaxy) states:

> “In this journey, you will participate in an experiment on the value of memories and information, deciding what actually holds value for you.”

True words! This whole campaign is, among other things, a big experiment where we will see how people value the various reward options. Will they sell the memories, will they go for the loot at hand, or will they accumulate and finish the main quest, receiving the Saand’s Story digital asset bundle?

And perhaps on top of that all: How strong of a bond do people have with their DACs? Will people save up their memories to aid their DAC in the final competition? Or will they instead solely focus on their more direct, and immediate return on investment?

It will be interesting to watch, for sure!

## Which Wallet?

There has been some discussion concerning which wallet to use. Though you will need to submit/use a wallet that is registered with a faction, you will also need to (if you choose to) perform 300 moves in Escape Velocity. Clearly, that would go a lot better with SolFlare’s Burner wallet option.

If you used a Ledger to register with a faction and stake your assets (which would be a super smart idea!) then this “problem” is exacerbated quite a bit. Approving 300 moves (forgoing scans) with a Ledger will be very time-consuming!

Fortunately, it looks like there will be a way to change wallets after the first Mission. You may have to move your Claim Stake to your burner (temporarily, please get it out after!), but that should allow you to complete most (if not all) of the quests!

![Screenshot 2023 05 15 at 12.41.00](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/86973b371e2c215b352a48df96f3177b881d04739f741fe4259fd2554e298fe9.png)

Wallet Discussion

## Final Words

We will update this guide as more quests become available, and the missions progress. Good luck, and go help Saand get his memories back!
