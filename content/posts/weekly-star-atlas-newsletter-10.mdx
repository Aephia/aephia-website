## News

The first mini-game module, SCORE, will launch next week, December 16. This has been confirmed during a last-minute, special  town hall edition last Friday, December 10th. 

Additionally, during the last two Townhall meetings,, several updates were announced by the Star Atlas team, namely:
- FTX Pay Integration to be able to fund wallets in USDC, SOL, and ATLAS.
- Blockchain program in devnet
- SCORE on-chain program audit on going
- SCORE QA in final stages

## Assets

Several new ships will be launched on the [GAO](https://staratlas.com/gao-brochure.pdf) over the course of the coming weeks. Visit this [news page](https://aephia.com/star-atlas/images-for-all-9-missing-ships-leaked/) on our website to see more images of these ships. 

The team is planning to take a snapshot right before SCORE launches, and will use this information to airdrop every player the right amount of resources to fully stock their ships. Ships purchased after the snapshot date will not come with any of the required resources, such as food, fuel, and ammunition. These can however be purchased on the Marketplace using ATLAS. In the future, the revenue captured from player purchases of resources will flow directly into the DAO treasury, to be distributed to governors at some later date. Governors are people who stake POLIS.

We’ve learned that MORE -the next playable module to launch Q2 2022- will most likely look and feel much like SCORE does. So expect a straightforward, simple UI to manage your future mining operations. Just as with SCORE, with later releases this will be greatly expanded upon.

Perhaps more interesting is that when MORE launches, players will be able to mine and create the 4 resources required to keep their fleet going in SCORE. This should lower the costs for SCORE and subsequently increase profits. Any surplus can always be sold on the Marketplace to others to increase those profits a little further!

## Staking

Speaking of POLIS staking, this feature is targeted to be made available on February 3, 2022. Staking contracts have been completed and the feature is currently undergoing the audit process.

## Gameplay

Previously the idea was that only the High risk zone would grow over time as more players enter the game, but now Michael Wagner, the CEO, confirmed all three zones will grow over time instead (safe, medium & high risk). Growth in these zones are in the form of resources, economic opportunities, and activities.
