_Welcome to our 4 2 6th newsletter on Star Atlas! This is a weekly newsletter, published by Aephia Industries, that is focused entirely on Star Atlas. Here we try to aggregate all the newsworthy tidbits that were dropped by the team throughout the past week._

The next *426Live* is coming! A good thing for this newsletter too, for without its announcement, the past week would have been a very quiet one. Read all about it below!

Besides this headline news item, the team also published the [20th issue of the Roadmap Scan](https://medium.com/star-atlas/atophs-lair-star-atlas-roadmap-scan-20-31d945ccbf6f), in which Wenn & Yago's exciting adventure on the planet Gerio takes another unexpected turn!

## 426Live: NYK

Last Friday, during the [second episode](https://twitter.com/Ashes_LS/status/1570826885030121473?s=20&t=tFyk8tBAwnPCA4_I1qyabw) of Ashes her new show on Twitter Spaces: *The Future of Web3 Gaming*, Santi (Community Lead) shared the news everyone has been waiting for: The next 426Live is coming! And it will take place on **September 29th**, starting at **17:00 UTC**. The team plans for this event to take approximately 1.5 hours. If you like to enjoy a special DJ set kickoff, be there 30 minutes early at 16:30 UTC.

For this second episode, the team decided to stop trying to use Discord for hosting, and instead rely on a platform that is better suited to events like this: **Twitch**!

In the official announcement, the team mentions that "this event marks the grand finale on the cusp of the Star Atlas summer."
## Program

Three weeks ago, Michael (COE) [already shared](https://intel.aephia.com/newsletters/weekly-star-atlas-newsletter-43/) what we should expect during this show, but it was noted there should be a few surprises in there as well! For your convenience, we've added the list below once more:
- The release of Showroom R1 (previously: pre-alpha). This game's distribution will rely on a “unique technique”, using a new partnership.
- A presentation on “Sustainable Governance” by Dan Park (legal council)
- The roll-out of the Atlas Locker (Atlas Staking)
- A presentation on the Foundation Kit, which is a toolkit that allows for the integration of Solana (e.g. a wallet) into Unreal Engine 5 (aka *Foundation SDK*)
- A talk about how they plan to solve the potential less-than-optimal-user-experience of using Cold Storage (e.g. a Ledger) while playing the game.

## Registration

Like last time, the team put out an [EventBrite link](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/426live-nyk-star-atlas-product-launch-keynote-free-entry-tickets-421098606267) via which you can officially register your attendance for this event.

## SCREAM Progress

The team had some more updates with regard to progress this time around, so buckle up!

The Game Design team has been working with the Economics team to define "layer levelling" and ship progression strategy. Perhaps more concrete, the Blockchain team has been busy testing the Starbase upgrade contract, updating the movement system & completing Starbase crafting. The Cargo, Crafting, Player Profile, Points and Points Store programs are all ready for internal auditing.

The UX department has worked hard on wireframes and information architecture for Crafting, Inventory and Cargo. Meanwhile, the Web team has started work on combat functionality. Lastly, the Art team has managed to get some of the Starbase assets into PlayCanvas.

## Volant Studio Showroom

The first release of the showroom is expected to coincide with the 426Live event on September 29th! These last few weeks the team has been busy setting up the distribution for the game, and the team has not reported that they have the distribution method locked in. Everything should be good to go!
## System Requirements

The latest on *minimum* PC requirements is this:
- CPU: Quad-core Intel / AMD 2.5GHz
- Memory: 8 GB RAM
- Graphics Card: Nvidia 1080 / AMD 5700RX
- 20 GB of free disk space

## Graphic Novel

While the team is apparently still working on setting up the distribution for the issues of their upcoming Star Atlas comic, we've now learned that they are in fact working on their own *comic reader*. The team reported having made progress on their UI mockups for this tool.

## Survey

The team has published a [survey](https://forms.gle/BH8eGP9nqCkJ9UwJ9) in an attempt to get to learn more about their community's taste when it comes to games.

In it, they ask questions both about traditional games and web3 games, and answering it will take about 2-3 minutes on average.

The survey closes Friday, **September 23**, at **16:00 UTC**!
