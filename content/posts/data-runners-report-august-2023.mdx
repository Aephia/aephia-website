### NOTES

**1.1 USERS – new faction registrations weekly**

Faction registrations are wallets that have registered to one of the three factions. This is
a requirement for playing S.C.O.R.E. We are measuring new registrations within a week.

**1.2 USERS – active users in S.C.O.R.E. monthly**

Active users in S.C.O.R.E. are wallets that have made at least one transaction (e.g., refill, deposit, withdrawal) with the S.C.O.R.E. program within a month.

**1.3 USERS – active users marketplace & lockers weekly**

Active users on the marketplace are wallets that have at least made one trade in goods on the Star Atlas marketplace within a week. We excluded resources in this query because the count would then be very similar to active users in S.C.O.R.E. | Active users for the lockers are wallets that made at least one transaction with the ATLAS or the POLIS locker within a week.

**2.1 LAND – claim stakes & CSS land trading volume daily**

This is an aggregate of the ATLAS and USDC trade volumes within one day of the claim stakes & CSS land on the marketplace, primary and secondary market – measured in USDC.

**2.2 SHIPS – star atlas marketplace ship volume daily**

This is an aggregate of the ATLAS and USDC trade volumes of all ships on the marketplace within one day – measured in USDC.

**3.1 DAO – star atlas DAO treasury**

The Star Atlas DAO Treasury comes from two sources. First, the R4s sold on the marketplace for ATLAS go to the DAO treasury. Second, a marketplace fee has been introduced. One third of that fee goes to the DAO treasury. Those fees are collected in ATLAS and USDC, depending on the currency of the traded good. This chart shows the marketplace fees collected in USDC for the DAO treasury.

**3.2 TOKENOMICS – ATMTA selling ATLAS & POLIS**

On January 13th ATMTA started selling ATLAS & POLIS against USDC to improve liquidity and runway. Michael Wagner said their “objective is to be market neutral, we don’t want to have any impact on the market rate either up or down.” On the 26th of April ATMTA stopped selling ATLAS & POLIS because prices were going down. Up until now ATMTA only sold rewards they received from the POLIS locker (POLIS) or marketplace fees they received in ATLAS.

**5.1 ACTIVITY – players activity over factions**

Active players in S.C.O.R.E. are wallets that have made at least one transaction (e.g., refill, deposit, withdrawal) with the S.C.O.R.E. program within a month. The active and inactive players are divided into the three factions.

**5.2 ACTIVITY – firepower over factions**

Active players in S.C.O.R.E. are wallets that have made at least one transaction (e.g. refill, deposit,
withdrawal) with the S.C.O.R.E. program within a month. It has been shared in the foundation room discord channel that the multiplier for component sizes has been changed. The old furmula was “two Small class components equate to roughly 73,5% of the output of one Medium component”. The new formula is “one medium component is 2.5x the output of one small component”. If we assume that a missile bay has twice the firepower of a weapon hardpoint and we set the firepower of an XXS weapon hardpoint to 1, then we can calculate the firepower for each ship and thus for an entire faction. Max firepower is the player with the highest firepower of each faction.

**6.1 CENSUS – Firepower & VWAP over faction**
