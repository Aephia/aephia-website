As was previously confirmed, all ships bought through the GAO ([Galactic Asset Offering](https://staratlaswiki.org/wiki/GAO)), are delivered fully loaded. However, the ships will still be fully customisable. All the various modules, can be changed/sold as needed as confirmed by Bunthius (Star Atlas CPO): “_The plan right now is that all GAO ships come with filled crew/component/module slots. In the game, new ships will be barebones and only limited components are bespoke and fixed. You’ll be able to un-slot all these GAO filler items and sell them, and respec individually._“
