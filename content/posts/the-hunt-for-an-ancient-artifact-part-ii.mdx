The Star Atlas team published the [second part](https://medium.com/star-atlas/star-atlas-nft-ancient-artifact-ustur-de789d607b7) of “The Hunt for an Ancient Artifact” were ONI, Ustur, and MUD battle for the infamous [Vintage Astronaut Suite](https://play.staratlas.com/market/6Y4bSkNwcugHzDc8eDSqDL9m15mQi9Mc8UncxVm5YZRX) that was part of the Armstrong Forever event. Aephia is humbled to see a shout-out from the team as “one of those notorious meta-guilds in Star Atlas working together across factions, a combination of Ustur, MUD, and ONI, united by common goals.”
