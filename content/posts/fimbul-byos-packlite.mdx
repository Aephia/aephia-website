The Fimbul BYOS Packlite is a rare medium freighter ship NFT in the Star Atlas metaverse. In this guide, our Star Atlas veterans will give you an overview of the role of this ship, module configuration options and component configuration possibilities. We will talk about fleet and travel considerations before we take our look at buffs via charms and skins and complete our guide with the crew member considerations.

See how the Fimbul BYOS Packlite is doing on the Marketplace on our [Ship Market Overview](https://aephia.com/star-atlas-ships/).

BYOS stands for Build Your Own Ship. Fimbul offers a full do-it-yourself package for the starship mechanic who likes to get their hands dirty. We do not guarantee all parts have survived their space trek to your doorstep but our handy guide will help you find a suitable replacement at a nearby scrapyard. Once assembled, your Packlite provides cozy and sufficient amenities for the space dweller who is resillient to life on the open slowave sea. A robust cargo hold can extend beyond its walls to take on those extra chunky hauls that pay the big bucks. If you need any extra room, reinforced mycellium bungies will ensure you use every last inch of cargo space. For the frugal cargo freighter, the Packlite is your dream boat.

### A fully equipped Generation 1 model

Remember that all ships bought through the GAO ([Galactic Asset Offering](https://staratlaswiki.org/wiki/GAO)), are delivered fully loaded. In later game stages, new ships will be barebone and only limited components are bespoke and fixed. So – you’re not only getting a Generation 1 model, but you’re also getting more bang for your buck!

However, the ships will still fully customizable. All the various modules can be changed/sold as needed as confirmed by Bunthius (Star Atlas CPO): “_The plan right now is that all GAO ships come with filled crew/component/module slots. You’ll be able to un-slot all these GAO filler items and sell them, and respec individually._”

### Earning potential of the Fimbul BYOS Packlite

If you’re wondering how much you can earn with your Fimbul BYOS Packlite in Star Atlas, here are some facts:

Before Star Atlas releases the full game in the Unreal 5 engine, all players have the opportunity to participate in the browser game (called SCORE) with their ship NFTs to generate revenue (learn all the details about the [Star Atlas mini game](https://aephia.com/star-atlas/what-is-the-star-atlas-mini-game-score/) in our guide).

If the player provides his ship to his faction (ONI, MUD or Ustur), he will receive ATLAS, the in-game currency of Star Atlas, in return. This amount is measured by the **VWAP** (the “volume weighted average price” at which the ship was offered in the Galactic Asset Offering) of your ships. For the Fimbul BYOS Packlite, the VWAP is **$3,513.13** USDC.

So if you have the opportunity to buy this ship at a price below the VWAP, this could be a good deal for you (of course no financial or ship advice).
