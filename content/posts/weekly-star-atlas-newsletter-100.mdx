Last week was relatively quiet, though there for sure were some exciting developments. Not only did SAGE Labs break the 15% daily Solana transactions barrier, but the team also released SAGE Labs Development tools!

On top of that, the latest issue of CORE is finally available on Magic Eden. We also got a few sneak peeks from the team, and the team published an infographic showing all the loot you can win/craft in SAGE Labs.

Lastly, this issue you are reading is our 100th Star Atlas newsletter! Let’s get started!

Newsletter 100! 🥳

## Issue 100

You are currently reading the 100th issue of this weekly Star Atlas newsletter! If you are still reading these on our website, you may want to consider subscribing (see below), as this newsletter is here to stay!

Over two years ago, on **October 3rd, 2021**, we published the very first issue of what has become the longest-running newsletter on Star Atlas development! Clearly, 100 issues can not fill 104 weeks, but that can be easily explained, as we take breaks in tandem with the team (around Christmas & NYE). After all, there is nothing to report from the team’s side during those weeks either.

Originally, we started out on the Revue platform, which was owned by Twitter at the time. Here, we published the first 63 issues until Elon Musk unfortunately pulled the plug. Since then, we moved to our own website, where we have been publishing ever since.

It just so happens that we launched an [archive](https://aephia.com/star-atlas-newsletters/) a few months ago, where you can find [the last 37 issues](https://aephia.com/star-atlas-newsletters/). Unfortunately, the issues that were published on Revue are missing. We have some backups available but have not yet had the time yet to restore these.

Lastly, thank you very much for reading this newsletter! We hope it helps you stay up to speed on the latest developments in Star Atlas.

SAGE Labs – Obtainable Loot (Crafted & Raffled)

## SAGE Labs

The team published the above infographic last week, which helps illustrate the rewards available in SAGE Labs for crafting (left) and winning (right).

As you are no doubt aware, eight weekly raffles will be held this year, with this streak kicking off later this month (in all likelihood). The prize pool shown above contains the drawings for all eight raffles! 

To join in on the raffles, you will need to craft (or buy) Golden Tickets in SAGE Labs, which will then have to be taken out of the game (through the CSS) and submitted to a specific raffle. This will burn the ticket, but give you a chance to win some of these amazing prices! You can submit as many tickets as you want!

We published the prizes for the first raffle (exact date unknown) in [issue 98](https://aephia.com/star-atlas/weekly-star-atlas-newsletter-98/).

### Transactions

Yesterday, on Sunday, October 8th, SAGE Labs dominated Solana’s daily transactions. Over the whole day, 15% of all transactions happening on Solana were directly related to SAGE Labs gameplay.

Aephia Data Runners – SAGE Labs Transactions

On Sunday, exactly 15.01% of all transactions were SAGE Labs-related. Observing the trend, it does not yet seem an end is in sight, so we’ll likely circle back to this next week!

### Official Stats

The team published some stats today as well, which we copied below:

* 16,000,000+ Solana transactions
* 2,000,000+ DAILY transactions
* 8,577 profiles created
* 37,640 fleets created

It looks like SAGE Labs is picking up steam!

## Breakpoint 2023 Meetup

Like previous years, Solana is hosting their annual Breakpoint conference again, which is an event primarily focused on developers and businesses that are built on Solana. This year’s edition will take place in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, starting October 30th (Monday) and ending on November 3rd (Friday).

Last year, there was a community meetup organized in the same city, in the same week, and this year is no exception! And like last year, team members will be present!

On **Tuesday, the 31st of October**, a two-part event will kick off, to which you are warmly invited! Note that as this is a community-organized event, you will have to pay for all your consumptions (and dinner) yourself. Below is the **_tentative_** schedule (Amsterdam time):

**18:00 – 20:00:** Dinner cruise in the Amsterdam Canals (_74 EUR p/p_). Dinner will consist of a luxurious Indonesian buffet. The boat will leave at the IJcatcher (which is where the ferry to/from the Solana conference venue also stops), and the trip will end near the venue where the second part of the meetup will take place.

**20:10 – 23:00:** Socializing & Drinks in the “Groene Paleis” (which translates to: “Green Palace”).

If you are looking to join, there is a [form that you will need to fill out](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1DcJu81VzGD3OdK5f8e45Ixuw0Ro407FknYxZglNHW8g). This will help the organization to determine if they made the right choice for boat size and venue size, and allow them to change things if necessary.

_**Note:**_ A Luma page for both events (where the official registration takes place) will go live somewhere this week!

Star Atlas – Developer Tools (Pearce-manufacturer-style)

## Development Tools

Last week, the team [released](https://medium.com/star-atlas/star-atlas-opens-free-development-solana-builders-creators-sage-labs-programs-1d6cbcdd33d7) a bunch of [code, documentation, and API endpoints](https://build.staratlas.com/dev-resources/apis-and-data), to encourage development around SAGE Labs. Michael had already shared months back that this was going to happen, and now the team made good on that promise.

Using the development tools, it is possible to create services that interact directly with the on-chain programs that run SAGE Labs. It’s possible to build new user interfaces using the APIs (endpoints) that the team now made publicly available. This means that you hardly need any knowledge about the on-chain programs in order to build a completely new interface for the game. You can also use the tools available to create services that run next to SAGE Labs to improve your gaming experience.

On top of this, people interested in using some of the tech Star Atlas created in their own games can now use the Player Profiles or ATLAS Prime services.

CORE Issue #8 – Limited edition Magic Eden cover

## CORE: Act 2

After a few weeks of uncertainty, the 8th issue of CORE, which is the 2nd episode of Act 2, has finally become [available](https://magiceden.io/sft/5tRHmff94aXydfVMaMTnGh9Hcgp5Mqq5TsdFBaYixbWj?name=Core-Act-2---Episode-2-(Magic-Ed) through Magic Eden!

The limited edition, Magic Eden cover will set you back 0.864 SOL (a little below $20 at the time of writing). It is available for one more week until October 16th!

## Chris Interview – Metaverse Nomads

The Metaverse Nomads [interviewed Chris](https://www.youtube.com/live/ZLIgPEG3b0g?si=hbiL_NmvfwbCf4tg) (Director of Game Economy), this past Sunday.

One of the interesting bits Chris shared is that the team has come up with a way to make SDUs less bot-able. It has not yet been implemented but should be forthcoming.

Finally, Chris mentioned that there are currently about 170,000 XXS ships active in SAGE Labs (which is more than remains in SCORE). In addition, “dozens and dozens” of commander ships have also found their way into the game. At one point, someone moved in 60 commander ships in one go.

Though there were not many new revelations, it is definitely worth a [watch](https://www.youtube.com/live/ZLIgPEG3b0g?si=hbiL_NmvfwbCf4tg) if you care about the economy and want to learn more. And who doesn’t? 

## Sneak Peeks

We’ve seen glimpses before, but to wrap up this week’s edition, here is the finalized Ogrika Niruch ship!
