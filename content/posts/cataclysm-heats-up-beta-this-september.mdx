_“Long ago, the rogue planet **Iris**, rich with invaluable materials, collided with seven child planets in a remote region at the galaxy’s core. From this cataclysmic event, the region now known as **The Cataclysm** was born.”_

_Over a century ago, humans, aliens, and sentient androids waged a brutal conflict over these riches—the infamous Convergence War. Since then, the factions have kept their distance, leaving the Cataclysm to be picked over by privateers, treasure hunters, and the desperate who had nothing left to lose._

_However, you are not like them. You command a powerful fleet, a force that will succeed where so many others have perished. Fortune favored you as you uncovered a massive ore deposit—wealth beyond imagination, enough to make you a legend. As you prepare to begin the mining operations, however, your sensors blurt out an alarm! You’re not alone…_

_A fleet from a rival faction is closing in, aiming to take what is rightfully yours. In the vast expanse of the Cataclysm, where cosmic currents rage and the deadly Tufa can appear without warning, there is no room for negotiation. There is only one outcome: victory or ruin._

_“**All hands! Battle stations!”**_

Our 4th Anniversary celebrations are drawing to a close, but we’ve still got two more things to share with you. Today, it’s a brand-new **Cataclysm Video** _and_ a **Public Beta Announcement**!

We first unveiled **Cataclysm**, our community-made tribute to Star Atlas, back in December 2022\. Since then, _Valkynen_, our dedicated developer, has poured countless evenings and weekends into bringing the game to life. His efforts culminated in the announcement of our first internal Alpha test last year, which kicked off shortly after the 2024 COPA event.

Progress has been a bit slower since then, as crunch time at Valkynen’s day job (also in game development) took its toll. But we’re happy to say: we never stopped moving forward.

## Cataclysm in Action: BTH vs. ZeSKK

A few hours ago, well-known content creator **BeyondTheHorizon** and Star Atlas lore master (and penguin wrangler) **Jose**, aka **ZeSKK**, faced off in a live match! They each picked up a deck and dove in, despite never having played a game like this before.

It’s a great watch, especially if you enjoy seeing two fresh, but famous community/team members duking it out:

_Major thanks and appreciation to both of them for taking the time to try out our game!_

## Public Beta Coming!

And finally, while there’s still work to do, we’re excited to share that the first chance to try out Cataclysm is coming in the form of a **public beta** this **September (2025)**!

We’ll share more details as we get closer, but if you’re eager to try a Gwent-inspired twist on Star Atlas gameplay, there’s a good chance you’ll be able to do so very soon!
