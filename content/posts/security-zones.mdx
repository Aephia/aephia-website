In Star Atlas, there are 3 [faction security zones](https://www.staratlas.com/white-paper.pdf).

From the safest one, where PVP (player versus player) is not allowed, and ships cannot be damaged or destroyed, to the most insecure zone, where full combat is allowed, and the destruction of assets is a permanent.
