Star Atlas CEO Michael Swagner just confirmed few points about Ship mission & resources management in the mini Game called “SCORE” by the Star Atlas team.

* Regarding **mission duration**, there’s **no limit of time**, it will **continue to run** as long as there’s **enough resources in stock** to fuel/power and upkeep the **mission loop**. You just need to periodically add the resources you used the most to **balances your stocks for whole fleet**.
* All ships have a range of efficiencies and deficiencies, leading to different operation costs. Nevertheless, **it has minimal impact on earnings potential**, as earnings are adjusted to account for those differences. As they develop more sophisticated mechanics, those differences will be more apparent.
* Ship resources refill will require interaction. **The time requirements depend on ship sizes**. **Larger ships can go longer between restocking**.
