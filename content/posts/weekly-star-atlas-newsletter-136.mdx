_Welcome to our 136th newsletter on Star Atlas! This weekly newsletter, published by Aephia Industries, focuses entirely on the development of this ambitious game. Here, we try to aggregate all the newsworthy tidbits revealed \[mainly by the team\] throughout the past week._

An uneventful week went by, but that is no surprise as the team is likely saving the majority of the news for the **Town Hall** **later this week, on July 3rd**! We were, however, treated to the second Economic Forum, and of course, the Honeyland collaboration finally happened.

_Without further ado, let’s dive in!_

## Economic Forum #2

Last Thursday, the second-ever Economic Forum was held. Chris and Gareth from the Economic Team presented, while Santi and Dominic from the Community team were there to help out and guide the conversation a little.

The Econ duo had prepared a list of topics to address, but also reserved some time for discussion at the end. Below we’ll go over these topics one by one and some of the other highlights!

### Refactoring Food upkeep requirements

The duo first addressed the change made to Food upkeep a few weeks ago. Chris noted that much like the SOL fee costs, the Food upkeep introduced another (more or less) fixed cost to players who wanted to craft. It was clear that the small players could not keep the SB running. 

So, the team implemented a minimum crafting speed. No longer is Food required to keep crafting processes running at a Starbase. Instead, those are simply slowed down. This means that smaller players can now craft at a reduced rate, no longer needing to rely on other, bigger players.

Since the changes went live, the team saw the mean _deposit_ amount per day go up (i.e., players are contributing more Food per day). Part of the reason for this is that small players stopped contributing Food at all. Previously, the number of players contributing Food was trending a good bit above Toolkits, but now it has equalized to about the same amount.

Overall, Food consumption has not really gone down. Larger deposits from larger players have compensated for the smaller players dropping out. To summarize, the amount deposited has stayed relatively constant while the average amount contributed has gone up, and the number of users who have to upkeep has gone down.

### SDU sector CD has been lowered

Chris explained that the team, not just the econ departments, felt that SDU production could use another boost. That is why, at the last moment, the team decreased the time it takes for SDU deposits on sectors to be refilled from 10 to 9 minutes. 

Since the update, SDU production has climbed from 4 to 6 million per day, which will likely put more negative price pressure on the SDUs. These are still greatly overpriced, according to Chris.

### Adjusted LP payouts for Upkeep & Upgrade

The community was concerned about component upgrades such as the Field Stabilizers. Whales would fill them up within 24 hours and get all the premium LP rewards. To alleviate this, they went over the numbers again and decided to balance them instead(i.e., bring them to roughly the same LP reward level). Chris noted that, of course, there will never be a perfect balance as the prices for components fluctuate.

The team is happy with the end result of this change. As an example, Chris highlighted the market value of Particle Accelerators. It is now 25% of what it was before, which he greatly appreciated.

### Auto Contribution of Loyalty Points

The team switches to auto-contributing LP to help distribute it throughout the day instead of having it pile up at the end of the epoch. If it is automatically contributed when earned, then it’s easier to estimate where an individual player/contributor is ending up near the end of the day. This should prevent massive LP dumps right before an epoch ends.

LP will return in the future when the LP store goes live. Chris added that LP is really supposed to be spent on things like partnerships, cool badges, skins, and such. 

### Adjusted SDU requirements for upgrading

When the team did the big SDU overhaul, they vastly overestimated the number of SDUs that would be produced with the new meta. Their notion was that SDU production would increase by more than 20x, but in reality, it only about doubled. 

So, with the change from two weeks ago, the SDU requirement for upgrading Starbases has been drastically lowered. The end result is that two factions already have a Tier 3 Starbase, while Ustur is getting very close.

### Solana Fees

The economists presented a nice chart showing the Solana fee costs trending down between April and June. It highlighted the (about) 50% drop in fees paid by all players in that time period. They quickly noted that the value drop of SOL likely had a huge impact on this. They also added that the impact of this likely was not felt by everyone. They had not (yet) segregated the data into brackets for different portfolio sizes, so they could only talk about the aggregate data.

### Quarterly Economic Report

Chris and Gareth announced that the Quarterly Economic Report will be released right after the Town Hall on July 3rd. During the event, Gareth will come on stage for a few minutes to shed some light on the report. One of the big changes coming, announced during the Economic Forum, is that the team redefined their DAC ranking. Previously, they looked at aggregated activity, but that means that botters and spammers had too big an impact. Now, they are taking into account the actual output per DAC player.

We’ll see the result of this next week, July 3rd!

Meta Recipe – The Honeyland Explorer Badge

## Honeyland Meta Recipe

As [expected](https://aephia.com/star-atlas/weekly-star-atlas-newsletter-135/), the team announced their collaboration with Honeyland last week Monday, with the new Meta Crafting recipe going live this past Saturday at 0:00 UTC (Friday night for the US).

The collaboration was set up so that (up to) 100 unique holders of the badge would get a Honyland bundle airdropped. This bundle contains:

* Special badge that Honeyland players can add to their profile
* Generations 1 bee egg, which can be used inside the Honeyland game as a playable asset

To play Honeyland, players need to have bees, though every new player will start with a number of free bees. Honeyland is one of the few Web3 (mobile) games that can be played without acquiring any assets at all.

The catch was that there were only 100 badges available, while there was no mechanic in place to limit the amount a single player could craft. Fortunately, almost all accounts only minted one. Despite that, all badges were all crafted within the first 20 minutes of the recipe going live. As a result, many players were too late and could not craft the badge.

## Sneak Peeks

The team released some new in-game screenshots of the Busan XXS E-rapidfire guns montaged on the Busan Pulse (an as-of yet unreleased XXS Racer):
