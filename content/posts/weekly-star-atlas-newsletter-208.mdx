**Never Alone rewards are finally within reach, DAO Council elections are heating up, and December is shaping up to be one of the biggest months of the year for Star Atlas.** This week’s newsletter breaks down the Never Alone rewards, the current state of the Council race, and what to expect as we head toward O.RIGINS, major UE5 updates, and the year’s final community events!

_Let’s dive in!_

![Never Alone - Infographic](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/10ba9b83aec6778050dad3b5f5888a6648976e5789a858ffcd05de1b7792a235.webp)

Never Alone – Infographic from when Mission 1 was about to launch. Prizes never changed, though the DAC competition (on the right) was dropped towards the end.

## Never Alone Rewards

It took the team a little over 2 years, but the Never Alone rewards will be claimable very soon through metacrafting recipes accessible in SAGE Starbase.

As a refresher, the Never Alone campaign was hosted on [Zealy](https://zealy.io/cw/staratlas-never-alone) and consisted of answering questions (some within a specified time window) and performing social media actions. New questions were added throughout the campaign, so participants had to stay on top of things.

By doing so, people would earn XP on Zealy, and when they unlocked a certain amount, they could claim an on-chain memory. This would consist of Glimpses (first level), Fragments (second level), and Revelations (last level) for each of the 3 seasons (dubbed “Missions”) the team hosted.

The particularly cool thing here was that the individual quests all shared lore bits. Throughout the quests, a story evolved, in which a punaab named _Saand_, who lost his memory, slowly regained bits, while looking for clues to his past.

One of the fun aspects of this campaign is therefore that the Saand character is one of the prizes that can be claimed.

Over the three missions, 9 individual memory shards could be earned, 3 different glimpses, 3 fragments, and 3 revelations. These can be redeemed individually for a specific reward, or grouped in sets of 3 (all mission glimpses, fragments, or revelations) for a bag of rewards.

We’re listing all rewards once again below, starting with those that can be redeemed for individual memory shards:

**Mission 1:**

* Memory Glimpse: Exclusive Character Skin,
* Memory Fragment: VZUS Solos,
* Memory Revelation: Exclusive VZUS Solos Ship Skin

**Mission 2:**

* Memory Glimpse: Exclusive Never Alone Emote
* Memory Fragment: Fimbul ECOS Unibomba
* Memory Revelation: Exclusive CORE Century Cover

Star Atlas – Never Alone metacrafting recipes

Note that most of the single-shard prizes are already available in the metacrafting recipe menu, but the collections still have to be added. These should become available soon, and the team will make an announcement once they are available. 

## DAO – Council Elections

The elections for the 3rd term of the DAO Council are underway, and [voting](https://govern.staratlas.com/proposals/91cc73fa-0af7-41ea-86c5-bab7ffcfcb4f) has meanwhile been opened!

As a reminder, here are the candidates you can vote for:

* Emperor
* Q | Morangø
* 𝐋ᴀɴᴢᴇʀ
* ROME | Winston
* \[ECL\] YassFreeks
* \[EMP\] jith blade

As with the previous Council elections, the voting mechanism used here is the Single Transferable Vote (STV). This means you will be able to select up to 5 candidates in order, and if the PVP assigned to your top choice exceeds the quota, the surplus is divided pro rata among the voters’ second choices. This process repeats until five candidates have been elected.

As with the previous election PIPs, you can see the STV (Single Transferable Vote) algorithm in action using our [visualizer tool](https://stv.aephia.com/).

Here is a snapshot of the STV outcome at the time of publication (with a little over 83M POLIS committed):

Aephia – STV Visualizer – Council 3rd Term Elections

Jith blade would lose out, but a lot can still change over the next 10 days!

Voting is open for two weeks. It will close at the end of the day on **December 10th**.

## News Bits

* This week’s **Economic Forum** is expected to be an important session, with the community team confirming during last week’s Atlas Brew that Michael will be in attendance. While no further details were shared, they strongly encouraged everyone to tune in. The forum will take place on Thursday, December 4th.
* During the same Brew, the team announced that they will be hosting a **Town Hall** in December! They mentioned this will likely take place in the second or third week of the month.
* The z.ink **O.RIGINS** campaign will come with a marketing campaign.
* Michael (CEO) expects to have _less than_ two weeks of **downtime** between the A.LPHA test campaign conclusion and the start of O.RIGINS.
* As they do every year, the whole team will enjoy **2 weeks off** during Christmas and New Year’s. This season, that means from December 22nd until January 2nd, 2026.

## December / January

It’s not always easy to keep track of what was shared over time, so below is the list of things you can expect to happen/go live over the December/January timeframe:

* Town Hall (announced for mid-December)
* Holosim Chapter 2
* Major UE5 patch (including Galia Single Player campaign – MVP)
