The Calico Guardian is a legendary capital multi-role ship NFT in the Star Atlas metaverse. In this guide, our Star Atlas veterans will give you an overview of the role of this ship, module configuration options and component configuration possibilities. We will talk about fleet and travel considerations before we take our look at buffs via charms and skins and complete our guide with the crew member considerations.

See how the Calico Guardian is doing on the Marketplace on our [Ship Market Overview](https://aephia.com/star-atlas-ships/).

Calico’s flagship multi-role, exploration vessel, the Guardian, is a marvel of modern spaceship technology. Clean, sporty and full of utility, this capital ship can be the home of an extra large crew destined to comb the furthest reaches of the known and unknown sectors of our galactic neighborhood. All imaginable creature comforts and sustainable bio practices onboard this ship put the crew of any Guardian at ease as they explore for new life and new biomes.

Packed with two extra large chambers of explorer drones and dual cartography navigation rooms, the Guardian also doubles as the space charting headquarters for any and all exploration or data validation fleets. Comes standard with a double decker theater for keeping the crew entertained with the latest the metaverse has to offer in live, hyperlive and streaming entertainment. Stacked with massive turret cannons for heavy defense, if you had to choose only one ship to get you through your entire space life and career, you cannot possibly go wrong with the Calico Guardian.

### Manufactured by Calico

![calico ship manufacturer star atlas](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/41325d251377595c9d0478ce8d4c66ed1d06236a07f0eac8a551bb5198f067df.jpg "calico ship manufacturer star atlas")
Calico is one of the ship manufacturers that have aligned with not only one but two of the major factions: In the case of Calico, it is a major alignment with the MUD and a minor alignment with the ONI. Their blueprints and designs are therefore a mix of civilian, stealth, and military technologies.

The ships built by Calico are known for their “brilliant designs and industrial mechanical genius.” Given the market outlook from the Galactic Asset Offerings, Calico seems to be the only manufacturer for rescue vessels. With the Guardian and the Hero, Calico also offers a wider variety of multi-role ships.

If you ever want to build a Calico ship yourself, you will need the respective blueprint. How to get one? You will need to get in a manufacturer’s good graces. To get there, you will have to prove that both your interests are aligned and/or that you’re supporting them. In in-game terms, you will need to gain loyalty (aka reputation) with them, before they judge you worthy of building ships with their logo on them (accruing loyalty won’t be possible before the SCORE v1 and CREAM v1 modules have been released).

Gaining loyalty with Calico requires completing their missions. To gain access to these missions, you will either have to be a member of the MUD or ONI faction or you will need a faction passport. These passes function a little like real-world visas, allowing you to visit another faction’s territory and trade with them. More importantly, in this case, a faction pass will allow you to accept and complete missions for the manufacturers that are aligned to that faction.

Be aware that by being part of the MUD faction you will gain loyalty quicker with the Calico manufacturer since they have their major alignment with that faction. It will take you more time as an ONI to unlock Calico blueprints.

You can learn more about shipbuilding and blueprints in our [in-depth guide](https://aephia.com/star-atlas/star-atlas-shipbuilding-blueprints-loyalty/).

### A fully equipped Generation 1 model

Remember that all ships bought through the GAO ([Galactic Asset Offering](https://staratlaswiki.org/wiki/GAO)), are delivered fully loaded. In later game stages, new ships will be barebone and only limited components are bespoke and fixed. So – you’re not only getting a Generation 1 model, but you’re also getting more bang for your buck!

However, the ships will still fully customizable. All the various modules can be changed/sold as needed as confirmed by Bunthius (Star Atlas CPO): “_The plan right now is that all GAO ships come with filled crew/component/module slots. You’ll be able to un-slot all these GAO filler items and sell them, and respec individually._”

### Earning potential of the Calico Guardian

![star atlas ship calico guardian 02](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/71ebd745e4797f09e6702a09a6f130ed0318928380b96e77e2b839a0c38ebf61.jpg "star atlas ship calico guardian 02")

If you’re wondering how much you can earn with your Calico Guardian in Star Atlas, here are some facts:

Before Star Atlas releases the full game in the Unreal 5 engine, all players have the opportunity to participate in the browser game (called SCORE) with their ship NFTs to generate revenue (learn all the details about the [Star Atlas mini game](https://aephia.com/star-atlas/what-is-the-star-atlas-mini-game-score/) in our guide).

If the player provides his ship to his faction (ONI, MUD or Ustur), he will receive ATLAS, the in-game currency of Star Atlas, in return. This amount is measured by the **VWAP** (the “volume weighted average price” at which the ship was offered in the Galactic Asset Offering) of your ships. For the Calico Guardian, the VWAP is **$30,883** USDC.

So if you have the opportunity to buy this ship at a price below the VWAP, this could be a good deal for you (of course no financial or ship advice).
