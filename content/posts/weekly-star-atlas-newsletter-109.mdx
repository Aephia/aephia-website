With the end of the year in our sights, the past week was an eventful one! For one, the team’s social campaign, Never Alone, started a new chapter. But we also have news on a Web3 collaboration/partnership, with Michael (CEO) spending over 300k to acquire a Neo Tokyo Code NFT.

Besides these interesting events, the next episode of CORE is available on the Galactic Marketplace, and the Golden Ticket raffle entered its final weeks. And that is not even all, there is more!

Let’s dive in!

[Aephia Data Runners](https://flipsidecrypto.xyz/Aephia/star-atlas-global-overview-star-atlas---global-overview-dJhgb_) – Monthly Revenue (data shown is gathered up until early morning December 10th)

## December Revenue – Going Places

Last week [we reported](https://aephia.com/star-atlas/weekly-star-atlas-newsletter-108/) that November has been a good month for the Star Atlas team, financially. Not only were they cashflow positive, they made their first profit in a long while!

With that in mind, it is good to see the team’s _revenue in the first week of December eclipsed the whole month of November_!

Aephia’s Data Runners [broke the news](https://x.com/aephia/status/1732690158267535678?s=20) on December 7th, and it has been making the rounds in various forms (on X.com) ever since. For more insights into the Star Atlas economy, do check out their [free dashboards](https://flipsidecrypto.xyz/Aephia).

On this topic, Michael Wagner also [shared](https://x.com/at_mwagner/status/1733991880235557130?s=20) that the team’s monthly spending floats between $600-800k.

## Neo Tokyo Code

Something quite unexpected happened last week, that sure led to a decent amount of discussion. Michael Wagner sent out a tweet where he showed off his new super rare [Neo Tokyo Code](https://neotokyo.codes/) NFT and declared that he joined their Elite ranks.

[Neo Tokyo](https://neotokyo.codes/what-is-neo-tokyo) describes themselves as:

> Neo Tokyo is a collection of builders, developers, founders, and investors who strongly believe crypto gaming and metaverse experiences will take over the world.
> 
> We believe something very similar to **Ready Player One** will occur, and we want to be the community that was investing and building in that future years before it happens.

Michael purchased the NFT, which is valued at well over 300k, using his own money in an OTC (over-the-counter) deal.

Citizens of the Metaverse,

As we emerge from these winter months, and embrace the rising of the sun before us, it&#39;s with pleasure that I proclaim the formation of a new alliance. I am joining the ranks of the Elite in [@NeoTokyoCode](https://twitter.com/NeoTokyoCode?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

Together, let us conquer the impossible. [pic.twitter.com/gJWVfsU7Uy](https://t.co/gJWVfsU7Uy)
</XTweet>
 

Asked about his reasoning for acquiring this NFT, Michael shared that he believes the Neo Tokyo Code represents a sizeable community of gamers, with two key thought leaders in the Web3 gaming space: [Alex Becker](https://twitter.com/ZssBecker) & [EllioTrades](https://twitter.com/elliotrades).

> This will expand our reach substantially, at zero cost (to ATMTA), with the anticipation of amplifying all of our future announcements and growth in 2024.

Honeyland x Star Atlas

## Honeyland Collab

Another popular (mobile) Web3 game on Solana, Honeyland, has teased a collaboration with Star Atlas! Just a few hours after the publication date of this issue, the team has scheduled a [YouTube livestream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7sxTHA7v-g), _Honeyland x Star Atlas Alpha Blast_.

We know there will be Star Atlas elements showing up in Honeyland, but it is not yet clear if the same will happen the other way around. Given that SAGE Labs is explicitly mentioned, it would not be a stretch to expect potential Honeyland redeemables to appear in the game, though.

CORE – Issue #11 (Star Atlas – Limited Edition cover)

## CORE – Graphic Novel

This past Wednesday the special editions of CORE Act2, episode 5 went live for [sale](https://play.staratlas.com/market/C11SAYv6eeW6aimv8iLqwCnmTz6UYcSBX76y9pRgAmkY/) on the Galactic Marketplace! You can buy this limited edition (cover) for 20 USDC, but you can of course still read these comics for free using the web-reader provided by the team.

At the time of publication, there are a little less than 11 days left to get your hands on this edition.

The second alternate cover, for which previous editions were being sold on Magic Eden, will likely go live this Wednesday. As with the previous issue, it is expected this one will be sold on the Galactic Marketplace now that Magic Eden no longer supports SFT sales.

## SAGE Labs

A new patch was released this past week (December 5th), containing the following changes:

• Fixed an issue where numbered assets weren’t updating (i.e., Crystal Lattice, Toolkits, and Frameworks) • Updated Crafting fees. Given market conditions, this results in a lower fee for most assets compared to the last update

## Atlas Brew with Chris

Last week, Chris, Head of Game Economy, joined the Atlas Brew crew to talk about the recent changes to SAGE Labs, the way they want to announce economic changes in the future, and other, related topics.

Among other things, Chris shared the team’s intent to announce future changes affecting the economy in advance. Note that this announcement will not contain the full details, however. Doing so would counteract the purpose of the changes themselves.

If you are curious about the economy of the game, and what the team is thinking regarding patches and future corrections, definitely [give this Brew a listen](https://www.youtube.com/live/Wt1l0xtxdl0?si=eFYYdDIK4X3JNrAm)!

Puri – Your new best friend from the planet Akenat

## New Pet: Puri

Last week, on Wednesday, December 6th, the team teased “Puri”, as a “creature emerging from the sea of mists” on both X, their Discord, and the Altas Brew!

During the [Atlas Brew](https://www.youtube.com/live/Wt1l0xtxdl0?si=FRoAAwVuab-zNiwd), loremaster Jose explained that this is a pet that can be earned through Mission 3 of the Never Alone campaign. If you reach the highest tier award during the Never Alone mission, Puri can be yours! 

Jose also provided some background information on “his girl”. Puri, as is her name, is about 15cm in height, and hails from the planet Akanat, which is also the home planet of the [Punaabs](https://lore.staratlas.com/species-and-races/directory/punaab)!

Puri is the second pet confirmed to be obtainable by players. The first pet, which is already in the hands of some players, is the gaseous Tigu, which was part of the original _Rebirth rewards_.

![Saand](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/228778a5732e839d68858f2bc2586bdea10684c032e0b8ea3277090f74384e1c.png)

Never Alone – Mission 3 – Saand

## Never Alone

Mission 2 of the team’s _Never Alone_ social campaign has concluded! More importantly, Mission 3 has meanwhile started! Help Saand to get access to Etira, where he hopes to unlock more of his memories!

As with the previous 2 missions, you can gain XP by completing quests on the [team’s Zealy page](https://zealy.io/c/staratlas-never-alone/questboard). You can then use that XP to gain Star Atlas loot. Mission 3 loot consists of:

* Tier 1: Exclusive Prayer to Iris Emote
* Tier 2: Fimbul Airbike
* Tier 3: Puri Pet
