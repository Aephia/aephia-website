Star Atlas had a big week last week, with the launch of the new StarPath V2 referral system and the release of the very first SAGE iteration: SAGE Labs! A lot of players have meanwhile jumped into Labs, and though there are some show-stopping bugs (at least for some), it looks like most people react favorably to it.

Besides this, the 2nd Photography concluded, ATLAS Prime went live (as part of Labs), and we’ve got an overview of the prized for the first Golden Ticket raffle.

Let’s dive in!

Starpath Star Atlas x Buddy Link

## Starpath V2

The team launched the new version of their referral last Wednesday, Starpath V2\. This system has been completely rebuilt from the ground up, in partnership with [Buddy Link](https://buddy.link/), the creators of the first on-chain Solana referral system.

You can read about it in the [official statement](https://medium.com/star-atlas/star-atlas-starpath-buddy-link-referral-program-revolutionary-web3-discount-1586fcb8a021) from the team, though we definitely recommend checking out our [extensive guide](https://aephia.com/star-atlas/starpath-v2-everything-you-need-to-know/) to get up to speed on all the nuances.

If you previously had a Starpath V1 account with active referees, then be sure to create a ticket on the official Discord. The community team is resolving these on a case-by-case basis.

### Guild Referrals

In case you missed it, Aephia [created a script](https://aephia.com/star-atlas/secure-guild-referrals/) through which guilds can set up a Squads V4 multi-sig wallet, combined with a Buddy Link referral. This script is open-source, and all Star Atlas guilds are welcome to use it.

SAGE Labs: Play Now

## SAGE Labs

After roughly two years, the mini-game we’ve all been waiting for is finally here! [SAGE Labs](https://labs.staratlas.com/) went live this past Thursday, after close to two weeks of community-supported playtesting. 

### Guides

Over a month ago, we wrote a [Guide for SAGE Labs](https://aephia.com/star-atlas/sage-labs-a-guide/), which we updated to keep it mostly relevant. We are also in the process of releasing a 3-part “Missing Manual” series, of which we published the [first part](https://aephia.com/star-atlas/sage-labs-the-missing-manual-part-1/) last week. This guide’s focus is really on teaching people how to play the game.

Meanwhile, many content creators have already published various _Howto_ videos as well, which you will find quickly through a Google search. The team also published [their own](https://youtu.be/L2o8sNSarjM?si=pVWrgLZqyVsG7dTR)!

<YouTube id="L2o8sNSarjM" title="How to Play SAGE Labs - Walkthrough"  />
 

### Bugs

There are quite a few bugs at the moment, with many finding their fleets to be stuck, or unable to supply the right cargo to a fleet. The team has been busy fixing bugs before the weekend, and it is expected that they continue now that they have had some well-deserved rest after working overtime to get the game into a releasable state (though it has to be said, some may wonder if they reached that goal given the nature of these bugs).

Star Atlas – Golden Ticket

## Golden Ticket – Raffle #1

One of the ways in which to use the resources extracted & SDUs found in SAGE Labs is to redeem Golden (raffle) Tickets. These themselves can be redeemed in any of the upcoming raffles the team will organize on a weekly basis. Note: the raffle won’t start until the 4th week of SAGE Labs availability.

### Prizes

Though the first raffle is taking place a few weeks from now, the team did publish the prize list for this raffle. The prizes for raffle #1 are as follows (subject to change):

#### Ships

* 25x Fimbul Airbike
* 50x Fimbul ECOS Unibomba
* 10x Fimbul Lowbie
* 10x Ogrika Mik
* 5x Armstrong IMP Tip
* 2x Fimbul Mamba
* 1x Calico ATS Enforcer
* 1x Ogrika Sunpaa
* 1x VZUS ballad
* 2x Fimbul BYOS Tankship

#### Central Space Station – Real Estate

* 10x Ustur CSS Tier 0 plot
* 10x ONI CSS Tier 0 plot
* 10x MUD CSS Tier 0 plot
* 3x Ustur CSS Tier 1 plot
* 3x ONI CSS Tier 1 plot
* 3x MUD CSS Tier 1 plot

#### ATLAS

* 5x 1M ATLAS Bundle
* 1x 5.6M ATLAS Bundle

### $300k VWAP Value

Though the team shared previously that each raffle would give out prizes worth $150k (in VWAP), this first raffle actually contains prizes worth twice that value.

According to Michael, this is just for the first week. The reason is that it will take about 4 weeks for the raffle to take place (meaning people have plenty of time to redeem the tickets) and because they added the Fimbul BYOS Tankship, which was left over from the Escape Velocity movement test.

## ATLAS Prime

With the release of SAGE Labs, the team also [launched their ATLAS Fee Payer](https://medium.com/star-atlas/star-atlas-atlas-prime-pay-solana-network-fees-in-atlas-85472d5803d6) solution, [ATLAS Prime](https://medium.com/star-atlas/star-atlas-atlas-prime-pay-solana-network-fees-in-atlas-85472d5803d6). This service is built into the Labs user interface and allows players to switch seamlessly between having their transaction fees paid in Solana or ATLAS instead.

Though SAGE Labs asks if you’d like to activate this during registration, it can be very easily toggled during gameplay by clicking the cogwheel in the header.

## UE5 Photography Contest

The team has been hosting photography contests since the launch of Showroom R2.1.1, and last week, the second contest wrapped up! The theme for this one was “environment”, and we posted the winning submission below.

![Theme 2 winner](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/cba2a2105e328369fb74c1cfbeb0b75fbab947c360be524f06f2061e8b32c239.jpg)

Theme 2 winner (made by wallet starting with ’83P3Kg’) – Outpost 39

### Contest #3

The 3rd contest has already started, and the theme for this one is _Friends & Crew._

If you are looking to participate, [details on how to do](https://discord.com/channels/789226204980707409/1130924899058323557) so can be found on Discord.

## Never Alone – Mission 2

Last week, we reported that the Never Alone: Mission 2 was going to end when SAGE Labs would wrap up, but since then, we’ve learned that this is not going to be the case. Mission 1 has now fully ended, including the extension period that ran in parallel to Mission 2.

Mission 2 is still very much alive, however, and will see at least 9 new missions added soon. It’s unclear what the new end date is. it is also unclear if the campaign will still consist of 4 missions in total, or if the team will reduce this to 3, given that the produce-release timeline has now caused Mission 2 to remain open for a while longer.

## CORE

Last week, we [reported](https://aephia.com/star-atlas/weekly-star-atlas-newsletter-97/) that the Magic Eden cover for CORE #8 had not yet been added to their marketplace.

This week, Michael shared that the Magic Eden team will publish episodes 8 and 9 as originally agreed. From issue 10 onward, the team is reconsidering their strategy, but they do intend to keep releasing two covers per episode.

When Magic Eden publishes episode 8 (should be this week), they will run it for two weeks from that moment onward. The team will meanwhile stop selling their special cover on the Galactic Marketplace this Wednesday, after it had a two-week run over there.

## News Bits

* Nine days ago, the daily unlock of ATLAS and POLIS to ATMTA’s private investors finished. This means that a substantial inflow of both tokens into the ecosystem has come to an end.

## Sneak Peeks

The team released the first images of the Fimbul Mamba EX and even shared a (short) video of the ship [side-by-side](https://youtu.be/4oLjwELuZYk) with its sibling, the Fimbul Mamba. That wraps up this issue. See you next week!
