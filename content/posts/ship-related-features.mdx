Some titbits obtained from SA staff.

* There is currently no cap on the amount of ships that a player can control
* Collision physics should be present, but still unconfirmed
* There will be a training mode to earn your pilot’s/captain’s license.
* Partnership with Jet Protocol on leasing of ships is under way. No fixed date set yet though.
* Item specs/stats “rolling out soon”
* Different components will have different strengths and weaknesses
* There will be cooldowns for components/abilities like de/cloak for example. Details still to be confirmed.
* Main power draws will be shields, weapons, thrusters and stealth for defensive/offensive/evasive play styles. Also planned deeper mechanics like, for example, being able to scan the other ships to target subsystems to lunch the appropriate projectile and also enhance the appropriate countermeasures.
* It is expected that there will be 35-40 ships available for purchase by the end of 2021.
* Ships and main assets will need to either have a transfer fee paid or be physically transferred by another player when changing hands. Ships can’t just portal across the map ;)
* “Asteroid” ship featured in trailer confirmed to be in game!
