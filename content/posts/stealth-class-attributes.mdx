If we look at the description of the known VZUS ships, the opod is classified as “stealthy”. And the ambwe has “stealth features (that) reduce overall energy output to fly under the radar.”

However, if we look at the components and modules of these ships, we can’t see any special feature compared to other ships that would give the two candidates the special stealth feature described at the beginning.

Danny Floyd, CPO of Star Atlas, then stated that “the barebones ships will have an energy output suppression factor baked in as well as the default components that come with it will have stealth class attributes assigned.”
