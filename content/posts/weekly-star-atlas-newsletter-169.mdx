Fleet Rentals are just around the corner! Unless the team has a surprise in store, this will be the big focus in the coming week. To get everyone up to speed, last week’s Atlas Brew once again revolved around Fleet Rentals, and we’ve gathered all the latest details and screenshots for you below.

In other news, the first Community PIP has officially been approved, and two new PIPs are now open for voting. Plus, the Mamba EX is back in stock with a fresh recipe tweak, and Michael shared an intriguing new image in the Foundation Room—one that’s sure to spark some excitement!

_Without further ado, let’s dive right in!_

Star Atlas – Fleet Rentals \[Promo\]

## Fleet Rentals

The MVP of Fleet Rentals will go live this Wednesday, **March 5th**!

This past week, Atlas Brew spent a [second show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BAj8LoXghk) focused on the new feature, from which we gained a few new nuggets of information and updated screenshots. See our [previous issue](https://aephia.com/star-atlas/weekly-star-atlas-newsletter-168/) for a description of the Fleet Rental flow. Below, we’ll post the new screenshots with a description.

### Screenshots

![Screenshot 2025 02 26 at 12e](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/383852c842bedd418403b6f94f377fc48b3def5e17ba767be81ca3e917555caf.png)

Star Atlas – Fleet Rentals – My Fleet Inventory

The My Fleet Inventory was updated considerably, with the interface now showing much more information at a glance for each of the fleets you have available. It now shows the status of the Fuel, Ammo, and Crew. From here, like before, you can right away jump into putting one up for rent.

![Screenshot 2025 02 26 at 12c2](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/3dfa28776a11ac23c53d373fadad0eb13b487c737cd15dff2473cad9abcb6bd0.jpg)

Star Atlas – Fleet Rentals – My Fleet Inventory (B)

If you rented out any fleets, you now have a Close Rental button available. This button allows you to close the rental and ensure you get custody of the fleet back as soon as the rental period ends (or before if the person renting it cancels). Note that the Cancel Rental button is just there for development purposes. This button should not go live when this feature rolls out.

![Screenshot 2025 02 26 at 12b2](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/7528ea035a01f376fd49d436191b90f2beec012a8ac4d1608e28aa34d1ad9687.jpg)

Star Atlas – Fleet Rentals – My Fleet Inventory (C)

If you have been renting fleets from others yourself, then those will show up clearly as well, along with their status. Here, the Close Rental button will allow you to end the contract early and return the fleet to its owner or the market (depending on if the Owner closed the contract)

![Screenshot 2025 02 26 at 12d](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/039f87f3f8337a2bc11f4c51919c1b9c24c4406197920a48d80604f9d5d43ab4.png)

Star Atlas – Fleet Rentals – Fleets Available to Borrow

A similar transformation took place at the Borrow side of the UI (the second tab), with similar details having been added to the fleet list items over here as well. The currency is now showing ATLAS instead of dollars, and you can see the ships and status at a glance.

![Screenshot 2025 02 26 at 12](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/9d0f8123d727c61b49254813e75db0a92a094ebae05ca56c9da2299afb953907.png)

SAGE – Rental Fleet status

If you rented any fleets, then this will be clearly shown in the SAGE UI as well. 

### Learnings & Clarifications

Below are some of the things we learned (or got confirmed) this past week. Make sure to check [last week’s newsletter](https://aephia.com/star-atlas/weekly-star-atlas-newsletter-168/) for part 1 of the Fleet Rental breakdown as well!

* Fleets put up for rental can _not_ be used in-game.
* The above screenshots show ATLAS/minute, but the plan is to go live with rental measured in days exclusively.
* The owner can not determine the maximum duration of the rental period. They can only stop it, after which it will be removed if not rented out, or it will return to the owner (and stop) after the current person renting it ends the contract (or it runs out)
* The initial maximum duration for which one can rent a fleet is 24 days
* The minimum duration is a day

### Fee Breakdown

Michael (CEO) shared the contractual breakdown of the (10%) fee (posted with permission), which shows that there are four different parties involved:

1. **50%** — to the 2x Core developers of the lending program
2. **30%** — to ATMTA
3. **15%** — to a 3rd party involved in some design/frontend development and part of the original negotiations
4. **5%** — to the Star Atlas DAO

All in all, 65% will go to the 3rd party developers.

Note that there is a proposal in the Atlas Locker Addendum to lower the 10% fee based on the maximum achieved Tier.

Star Atlas – Fimbul Mamba EX

## Mamba EX Recipe

After a small hiatus, the [Fimbul Mamba EX](https://play.staratlas.com/market/MEXfyQHowwqoTHsN6yjfeXVaxZxALUFJAHuzY8gFiUu) has been restocked in the SAGE redemption rewards. However, the recipe was altered as the econ team concluded that the previous recipe simply made the ship too cheap to produce. The new recipe requires more of the same ingredients and now also requires SDUs:

* Titanium: 7,903,772
* Steel: 15.807,545
* Electronics: 5,269,181
* Power Sources: 4,311,148
* Field Stabilizers: 1,102,852
* Particle Accelerators: 632,301
* Crystal Lattice: 2,789,566
* Survey Data Units: 223,691

## DAO Proposals

As mentioned last week, two new proposals have been approved for voting! But the even bigger news is that the first community-created PIP was approved! [PIP-8: Star Atlas Comet: Community Meetup at Gamescom 2025](https://govern.staratlas.com/proposals/62506041-933e-4b3e-a450-a2596c15a801) was approved at the close (UTC) of this past Wednesday, with an 85.29% approval rate and 85 million PVP used to vote.

Two new PIPs have meanwhile gone up, and both opened up for voting this past Friday (UTC) at 0:00.

### [PIP-9: Adjust STV Backup Vote Handling to Prevent Unintended Vote Redistribution](https://govern.staratlas.com/proposals/1cc4bb6f-269b-46fa-b60b-a17f01b41ffa) **\[closes EOD** March 6th **(UTC)\]**

This proposal calls for an adjustment to the Single Transferable Vote (STV) system used by the Star Atlas DAO. Under the current rules, if only some voters list backup candidates while others do not, the votes from those who did list backups can be “supercharged.” To address this imbalance, the proposed change ensures that when votes are redistributed, only those ballots with a valid backup candidate move on to the next candidate. All ballots without a backup are removed from the total pool, and the quota is recalculated accordingly. This prevents any unintended vote “boost” and ensures a more accurate representation of voter intent. 

### [PIP-10: Star Atlas Council: Second Term & Beyond](https://govern.staratlas.com/proposals/ed887a4e-344e-44d6-8a47-c815d9e8ec8e) **\[closes EOD** March 13th **(UTC)\]**

This proposal defines the structure and timeline for the second (Term 2) and all **future** Star Atlas Council elections. It updates and extends the rules from the [first Council proposal](https://govern.staratlas.com/proposals/f5e7cde1-9a02-4670-ae40-1c932a4b8dad).
Key features include:

* **Five (5) Council Members**
* **Nine (9)–month terms** for all members
* A **one-month overlap** period (beginning Term 3) where newly elected members—referred to as **Council Member-Elects**—observe and prepare before officially starting their term
* An **election process** involving self-nomination, public campaigning, and a single ranked-choice voting round

## News Bits

Wrapping up this week’s issue, we’ve got three small bits of news for you left!

First, Michael shared this image in the Foundation Room last Friday, though he did not provide further comment:

![image](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/6efb67a42d542cf0c804ad9b9051ec1534949b94e4da07b0fb53f8fc5570b477.png)

Star Atlas – Mission Example(?)

It seems to be an example of one of the possible missions coming to SAGE with or after C4 has gone live. This one asks to engage 10 enemy fleets in exchange for 7200 XP.

Secondly, the Busan Pulse ship has been added to SAGE. Of course, this only matters to you if you are one of the lucky winners of one of these 30 ships during the Mega Mystery Week.

Lastly, the Community Team does not want to let go of their fun Friday meetings and Marble races, so they decided to continue those a little longer. If you want to hang out with them and other community members and potentially win some prizes, make sure to tune in on Fridays at 18:00 UTC!

_You’ve reached the end of this week’s issue! Thanks for reading!_
