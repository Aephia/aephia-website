Star Atlas – DAO

## DAO – Council Elections – Term 3

The campaign period for the 3rd term Council Candidates is about to wrap up! This Wednesday, November 26th, the Election PIP will go live! From then on, you will have two weeks to cast your vote!

Last week’s Atlas Brew gave a platform to 5 candidates running for Council member (Winston, unfortunately, could not make it). They briefly introduce themselves and go into their priorities. The election process and key dates are also briefly mentioned. In short, it’s a great [recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QMQwaQk3z4) to check out if you want to learn more about the Council, the election process, or to help you make up your mind.

Note that you can also find out more about these candidates and ask them questions in the new [DAO channel that was created for this purpose](https://discord.com/channels/789226204980707409/1438171298990788659) on the Star Atlas Discord.

As a reminder, here is the list of candidates:

* Emperor
* Q | Morangø
* 𝐋ᴀɴᴢᴇʀ
* ROME | Winston
* \[ECL\] YassFreeks
* \[EMP\] jith blade

## Community Meetups

This past Saturday, November 22nd, the Star Atlas TALA community hosted a [meetup](https://luma.com/7vnyd63y) during the YGG Summit in Taguig, Philippines. There was considerable interest, and it looks like everyone had a good time!

Star Atlas Meetup – Taguig, Philippines

### Meetup Abu Dhabi – December 12th

If you will be in Abu Dhabi during Solana Breakpoint, make sure to [register](https://luma.com/4kfrv8rq) for the Star Atlas meetup there as well! Despite the team not officially being present, the community will still meet on December 12th to nerd out on Star Atlas. This time around, the meetup is hosted in collaboration with Super Phoenix Sports, who will live-stream their racing tournament.

## News Bits

But that is not all! Here are some smaller news bits:

* Jose (Lead Noot) hosted another **LoreKeepers** event this past Thursday. There, he dove straight into the lore around Ahr, the destruction of Earth, and the birth of the MUD and ECOS factions. If you ever wondered what happened (according to ECOS history, that is), then you definitely want to check out the [recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6d8ydM2R4I)!
* Testing for **Holosim Chapter 2** has kicked off, with community members having been recruited (through a form) last week on the Star Atlas Discord to join in.
* The team started sharing the videos that Brad (Gameplay Engineer) showed during the Atlas Brew from 2 weeks ago on X. If you want to revisit the videos in a higher resolution, definitely check these out:  
  * [Video 1](https://x.com/staratlas/status/1989436200311296028)
  * [Video 2](https://x.com/staratlas/status/1990528398570238047?s=20)
  * [Video 3](https://x.com/staratlas/status/1991233439970840597?s=20)
* Lastly, Aephia introduced its own **Sage Editor Suite**, which builds on the web app with a similar name [released by the team](http://ses.staratlas.com). Viktor introduced this tool at the start of last week’s Brew.

## Sneak Peeks

Gary Sanchez (Vehicle Art Director) shared additional concept art for the _Fimbul Naga_ drone on his [Art Station page](https://www.artstation.com/artwork/JrdlZD). We are showing two of these visuals below, but check out that page for more shots!
