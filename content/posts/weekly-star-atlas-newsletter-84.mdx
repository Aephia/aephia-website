_Welcome to our 84th newsletter on Star Atlas! This weekly newsletter is published by Aephia Industries and focuses entirely on Star Atlas. Here we try to aggregate all the newsworthy tidbits that were dropped by the team throughout the past week._

After a few intense weeks, the team seems to have taken a short break from launching (sometimes surprising) new releases. With everything out there, the community is buzzing, and has been heavily engaged in Escape Velocity, the Never Alone campaign, trying to optimize their R4 supply lines, and, -let’s not forget- having a good deal of fun with Showroom R2.1!

With the imminent launch of the Star Atlas DAO formalization process on the horizon, and a good amount of releases planned for Q3, there is also plenty more to look forward to! 

With that said, let’s jump into the newsworthy tidbits we did manage to gather. It will be a short one, though!

## Escape Velocity

Now that Escape Velocity is a [real source](https://aephia.com/star-atlas/weekly-star-atlas-newsletter-83/) of R4 (Fuel, Toolkits, Ammunition & Food) for players, activity has been on the up, ever since the team stopped their offering, and thereby [unleashed](https://aephia.com/star-atlas/weekly-star-atlas-newsletter-83/) the player-driven economy!

Where, only a few weeks back, we were celebrating hitting 8% of Solana transactions during a single hour (during the Atlas Brew community event), we’ve now reached 8% transactions over a full day, for the past 2 days!

## Star Atlas Governance

No news yet on when the team will kick off the foundational phase of Star Atlas Governance, yet Q2 is about to wrap up. However, this Wednesday, the team is hosting an Atlas Brew that is focused on Politics, where the exact topic is undisclosed and marked as _secret_.

This is clearly speculative, but it could mean the launch of this phase of governance is imminent! Either way, tuning in this Wednesday, could be worthwhile!

## Space Stations

Danny (CPO) was kind enough to share some tidbits regarding future Space Stations. These Space Stations will be able to be upgraded with various specialized decks (e.g. Commerce, Shipyard, University – see the [White Paper](https://staratlas.com/white-paper.pdf) for more). Danny mentioned there will be a generous amount of deck slots present on each Space Station. Of course, upgrading your Space Station will unlock additional slots.

Additionally, we’ve learned that each deck comes with a small amount of local parking space for specialized careers/ships to dock at. Doing so will allow these ships to make quick transactions without going through general parking. With regards to the latter, more parking space can be added through Hangar Decks.

Lastly, each deck will be upgradable itself as well, besides the main hub.

## Small Tidbits

Besides some info in Space Stations, we got a few more bits and pieces of news:

* Every major, and minor(/banished) faction will get their very own Titan ship! _\[courtesy of Danny_\]
* EV will run longer than intended, to account for the recently implemented R4/economic change. It will be around until the team is close to rolling SAGE: Resource Extraction & Crafting _\[courtesy of Michael_\]
* Michael (CEO) added to this previous point: “We haven’t determined specifically the deprecation date, but it could be anywhere from 1-3 weeks in advance of REC”. When asked about why this time in between, he replied: “There are reasons I’m not at liberty to go into at this time.”

## A Glimpse into Development

As always, whenever possible, we wrap up our newsletter with some of the new work-in-progress shots shared by the team. Here are the (other, not already shown above) images shared last week:
