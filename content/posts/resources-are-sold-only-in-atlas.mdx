With the much anticipated launch of the [mini game SCORE](https://aephia.com/star-atlas/what-is-the-star-atlas-mini-game-score/), players will have to supply their fleets with resources (such as food, fuel or ammunition). These resources must be purchased in the marketplace.

According to Star Atlas CEO Michael Wagner, there will be no possibility to purchase them with USDC, unlike the ships offered on the marketplace:

“Resources can only be purchased with ATLAS. The revenue captured from player purchases of resources flows directly into the DAO treasury, to be distributed to governors at some later date.
All “in-game” expenses will be denominated in ATLAS.”

When asked, Wagner clarified that the “governors” are “the people that stake POLIS.”
