_Welcome to our 42nd newsletter on Star Atlas! This is a weekly newsletter, published by Aephia Industries, that is focused entirely on Star Atlas. Here we try to aggregate all the newsworthy tidbits that were dropped by the team throughout the past week_

---

This week has been relatively slow (news-wise), but the team did share a few things worth mentioning.

For starters, the team released their [17th Star Atlas Roadmap Scan](https://medium.com/star-atlas/the-truth-about-gerio-part-ii-star-atlas-roadmap-scan-17-2dea2ff4c211) last week, continuing the ongoing story of Wenn & Co. In this edition, their adventures on Gerio grow more exciting by the minute!

## Progress

Progress reports from the team have become pretty minimal over the past weeks, as the POLIS Locker has been released, the first release of the Showroom is ready to be launched and SCREAM reports stay mostly the same from week to week.

So, this week, we've grouped the highlights of the various reports in a single section:

**Showroom**
- The team is still wrapping up the distribution of the Showroom module

**DAO**
- Requirements are being gathered for the first DAO proposals
- Refinements are coming to the POLIS Locker interface
- ATLAS locking is feature complete (*note*: The team won't stake any ATLAS)

**SCREAM**
- Economy Design is R&D'ing the SCORE to SCREAM transition strategy. Additionally, they are modelling most other economic considerations/levers involved in the SCREAM economy (hangar spaces, LP, XP, fleet configuration, etc).
- The art team has started work on Planets & Starbases
- The web team has added Calico Guardian metrics into SCREAM in order to playtest.

## Ships

Last Thursday the team introduced the very first salvage ship on the marketplace: the Pearce D9.  The D9 is a legendary, capital-class ship, with a total supply of 460 ships and a starting price of 30,000 USDC.

It's important to note that in SCREAM, all ships will (at least initially) be capable of salvaging debris after battle, but ships with higher *salvage* ratings will be able to salvage more.

Longer term, salvaging will constitute an entire career field, and there will be much more to salvage than broken ships after battle. One could think of things like NPC missions, recovery requests by other players, and random wreckages & ruins. And of course, salvage ships will be capable of processing the salvage onboard, in order to capture the rare materials and ditch the rest in order to save space.

Besides launching a new ship, the team also shared a highly detailed interior shot of the Ogrika Thripid, taken ***within**** the Unreal Engine*.

## Wallet Changes

The team dropped support for the Sollet wallet on their website, and instead added support for the Exodus and Coinbase wallets.

Development work on the open-source Sollet wallet stopped a while back, and now the team has decided to remove support for this wallet from their website. For those who relied on this wallet, please migrate to another wallet such as Phantom ([instructions](https://help.phantom.app/hc/en-us/articles/4406527601811-How-to-migrate-from-Sollet)).

Simultaneously the team has decided to support two new cross-chain wallets: [Exodus](https://www.exodus.com/) and [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/wallet). The latter one has also received the “recommended” status from the team.

## Video Contest

The fun, [short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtxOxOw7qD0&list=PLjeYxND-TAmBN0uc6zJfJjaC9c7gN5-fY) that was shot by Star Atlas team member DaveyB (Content/Creative Producer) two weeks ago, led to an ad-hoc contest being organized last week for the community, in which everyone is encouraged to attempt to produce something similar.

The deadline for submission is this Tuesday (August 23rd), 23:59 UTC and there are a total of 3 Fimbul Lowbies that can be won by those participating!
