In answering a question as to how many [Pearce X5](https://play.staratlas.com/market/3ySaxSspDCsEM53zRTfpyr9s9yfq9yNpZFXSEbvbadLf) or [Pearce F4](https://play.staratlas.com/market/CWn74XJsh98zWVYWtzqn1dGuz96KFxb18pYQQfECuCzA) fighters can fit into a [Pearce C9](https://play.staratlas.com/market/6SriSyRDGm8tS7f3njPeFEqSu88MsfFjSBzjMdodenqU). Figures are not yet confirmed. However, Bunthius, aka Danny Floyd Star Atlas CPO, replied that numbers are estimated to be around 5 F4s and 10 F5s on the low end, and three times that on the high end. The C9 has a total of one 1 capital slot hangar. So, it looks there is still a lot balancing to be done. Watch this space for future updates.
