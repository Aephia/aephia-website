## News

This past week has been another milestone for both the Star Atlas team and the community with the launch of [faction selection](https://play.staratlas.com/leaderboards) and the [gameplay trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciFSSd39pAY). Afterwards, two new ships, namely the Pearce F4 and Fimbul ECOS Greenader, were made available on the [marketplace](https://play.staratlas.com/market) as part of the [GAO](https://staratlas.com/gao-brochure.pdf). These were all topped-off with the 18th Star Atlas Townhall meeting held yesterday, October 9.

## Gameplay

The game’s roadmap, as mentioned previously, will commence with ship missions that will enable players to start earning ATLAS. This will then be followed by basic land development. Lastly, space station construction would be launched to complete this initial roadmap. A geo coordinate system with the 3D Star Atlas map of the universe will also be released as part of this roadmap and is expected next year. Once all components are released, the team will then cycle through these areas for further improvement, enhancement, and efficiency. For ship missions, they confirmed that the initial utility of all ships will be the same. Resource consumption will vary based on ship type/class but ship category is not relevant at this very early stage in the mini-game. Individual playstyle will be crucial in ship configuration since it will affect your gameplay if you own assets that you do not want to play. In terms of rewards, ROI will be based on a ship’s weighted average value. 

For collective gameplay, DACs (also known as guilds) will each receive a DAO. The team is prioritizing the creation of the Master DAO followed by the DAC DAOs as multiple guilds already exist in the community. Other DAO types include Faction and Region DAOs. Currently, there is no definite date for this area of individual player profiles. Do note that the team is working with a third-party in setting up these DAOs.

## Assets

Ship specifications are now indicated for each ship in the marketplace in addition to its total supply and origination price at GAO launch. A list of ship modules announced so far can be found on the [Star Atlas wiki page](https://staratlaswiki.org/wiki/Ships#Modules). More images of available ships will be released over time through ship galleries. 

Individuals who own Pilot and Captain licenses from the [ReBirth campaign](https://play.staratlas.com/events?initialIndex=0) or through the marketplace have had these assets replaced by crew cards. This change was implemented in accordance with the team’s decision to change the model of those assets. New licenses will be airdropped to ship owners based on the ships they own, and afterwards it will be possible to earn them in game. Read the [Star Atlas Medium article](https://medium.com/star-atlas/legendary-surprise-for-rebirth-meta-poster-rewards-pilot-and-captain-license-holders-905a6c0a6f51) for more information about these crew cards. Speaking of crew, a final interesting tidbit is that the team is considering actual human mechanics such as aging, death, and birth among crew members.
