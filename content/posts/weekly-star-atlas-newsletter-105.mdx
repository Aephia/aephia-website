With the big Breakpoint reveals behind us, the flow of news from the team has, unsurprisingly, slowed to a trickle. But after working towards an event that big, this was, of course, expected. It does mean that this issue will be on the shorter side again.

The highlight of last week was, no doubt, the second Golden Ticket draw, which was once again a big success. This upcoming week will not only see the third such drawing, but it will also feature the first Developer Hour session. This may prove to be quite interesting to any developers out there.

Let’s dive in!

Golden Ticket Raffle #2 – Top-tier prize winnings

## Golden Tickets

Last week saw the 2nd drawing of the Golden Ticket raffle, with a little over 740k tickets having been submitted. In contrast, the first draw saw close to 960k tickets submitted. The fact that we’ve seen such a high number of submissions, despite the prize pool being half the (VWAP) value of the first draw, can probably be explained by looking at the Golden Ticket production chart.

Golden Ticket – Raffle Prizes – Week 3 

## Developer Hour

On Tuesday, November 14th, the team is hosting their first (of hopefully many) [Developer Hour](https://discord.com/events/789226204980707409/1171865103730233354) session on their Discord. This hour-long event will allow anyone interested in development on top of the Star Atlas-provided foundation to ask questions to developers and project managers from the team.

For this first episode, Buzzec (Blockchain engineer) and XCode (Project manager) will answer any questions. If you are a developer interested in expanding the Star Atlas ecosystem, be sure to join!

## Sneak Peeks

We don’t get that many public sneak peeks anymore, as most of these are foundation-room-only, which we are not allowed to share. Fortunately, some ship designers have added new pictures to their online portfolios, allowing us to share some new material with you all.

One thing the team did release on X was a [behind-the-scenes look](https://twitter.com/staratlas/status/1723747484261097787) at a character _skeleton_, while racing in a Calico Scud.
