Though a formidable fighter, the Ogrika Sunpaa creates a finely tuned balance between combat-readiness and long-haul creature comforts. For those far space escort missions, this Ogrika vessel is true to brand and provides ultra luxurious onboard accommodations. The multipronged, feather-like wings allow for agile combat maneuvering in atmosphere or in space. There is no shortage of firepower here to ensure safe travel for the mission and, of course, for the crew onboard.

### Manufactured by Ogrika

Ogrika is one of the ship manufacturers that have aligned with not only one but two of the major factions. A major alignment with the ONI and a minor alignment with the Ustur in the case of Ogrika. Their blueprints and designs are therefore a mix of civilian, stealth, and military technologies.

An Ogrika ship will let you experience “astronomical opulence” only attainable through the inimitable signature of the viciously wealthy punaab ship manufacturers. Busan ships are made mainly of the resources that can be found in higher abundance in the ONI and Ustur faction spaces.

If you ever want to build an Ogrika ship yourself, you will need the respective blueprint. How to get one? You will need to get in a manufacturer’s good graces. To get there, you will have to prove that both your interests are aligned and/or that you’re supporting them. In in-game terms, you will need to gain loyalty (aka reputation) with them, before they judge you worthy of building ships with their logo on them (accruing loyalty won’t be possible before the SCORE v1 and CREAM v1 modules have been released).

Gaining loyalty with Ogrika requires completing their missions. To gain access to these missions, you will either have to be a member of the Ustur or ONI faction or you will need a faction passport. These passes function a little like real-world visas, allowing you to visit another faction’s territory and trade with them. More importantly, in this case, a faction pass will allow you to accept and complete missions for the manufacturers that are aligned to that faction.

Be aware that by being part of the ONI faction you will gain loyalty quicker with the Ogrika manufacturer since they have their major alignment with that faction. It will take you more time as an Ustur to unlock Ogrika blueprints.

### A fully equipped Generation 2 model

Remember that all ships bought through the GAO ([Galactic Asset Offering](https://staratlaswiki.org/wiki/GAO)), are delivered fully loaded. In later game stages, new ships will be barebone and only limited components are bespoke and fixed. So – you’re not only getting a Generation 2 model, but you’re also getting more bang for your buck!

However, the ships will still fully customizable. All the various modules can be changed/sold as needed as confirmed by Bunthius (Star Atlas CPO): “_The plan right now is that all GAO ships come with filled crew/component/module slots. You’ll be able to un-slot all these GAO filler items and sell them, and respec individually._”

### Earning potential of the Ogrika Sunpaa

If you’re wondering how much you can earn with your Ogrika Sunpaa in Star Atlas, here are some facts:

Before Star Atlas releases the full game in the Unreal 5 engine, all players have the opportunity to participate in the browser game (called SCORE) with their ship NFTs to generate revenue (learn all the details about the [Star Atlas mini game](https://aephia.com/star-atlas/what-is-the-star-atlas-mini-game-score/) in our guide).

If the player provides his ship to his faction (ONI, MUD or Ustur), he will receive ATLAS, the in-game currency of Star Atlas, in return. This amount is measured by the **VWAP** (the “volume weighted average price” at which the ship was offered in the Galactic Asset Offering) of your ships. For the Ogrika Sunpaa, the VWAP is **$10,176** USDC.

So if you have the opportunity to buy this ship at a price below the VWAP, this could be a good deal for you (of course no financial or ship advice).
