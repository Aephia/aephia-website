Last Wednesday, the team hosted the 43rd Town Hall, which was a big one! It lasted well over two hours and was packed with the latest changes and updates from the team. Major highlights were the imminent DAO launch, the Star Atlas Summit, and an overhaul of the UE5 roadmap. But that is not all; the team also published the second Economic Quarterly Report of 2024!

_Let’s dive in!_

Star Atlas – Town Hall #43 – July 3rd, 2024

## Town Hall

If you missed the Town Hall or wish to see it again, make sure to check out [our recording](https://youtu.be/CayIW3FFlFg). In addition, we wrote an [extensive report](https://aephia.com/star-atlas/town-hall-report-july-3-2024/) covering most of what was shared during the event. Last but not least, the team also provided a [summary on X](https://x.com/staratlas/status/1808992386993041553)!

In our written report, we go over everything in great detail. In this newsletter, we pick out the highlights / big changes you need to know about.

Star Atlas – MUD Crew example

## Crew Launch

Launching the crew in Q2 did not come to fruition. There are several reasons for this, which can mostly be summarized by Michael’s words: This will be the team’s most critical release this year and quite possibly for a good while longer. The revenue potential for the team here is quite significant. On top of that, this may be the last time the team introduces an entirely new asset class for sale. Due to all this, more specifically, the team considered the following:

* **Marketing** – The team wants to launch a major marketing push around this sale. Not only has their focus shifted (as we see below) to onboarding more people into their ecosystem, but they also seek to maximize their revenue, as they need the funds to develop the game.
* **No Placeholder Art** – Previously, the idea was to have MUD crew members fully fleshed out cosmetically and use placeholders for the ONI and Ustur races. However, first impressions count. If this is a critical release, you better do it right the first time. Or at least, that may have been their thinking. Either way, the result is that this release will no longer come with placeholder art. All races are present, including their many (outfit) variants.
* **Market Conditions** – Current market conditions are not optimal for a launch, and Michael admitted this also plays a subtle role.

Note that the release has not been pushed out that far away, though the team did not want to give a new target to not take the air out of their DAO announcement (see below). Of course, if the new date were months away, then the target date would not have interfered with the DAO launch. In other words, the target date seems to be in the very near future, instead!

### Sale Specifics

The timeline around the sale will look like this:

* **Two days before the sale**: A snapshot of all ships will be taken. Every ship you own will be accounted for, including ships in SCORE, SAGE, and the Galactic Marketplace. There is less clarity about what happens with ships that are on 3rd party service escrows (e.g., marketplaces).
* **One day before the sale**: The crew packs & component bundles will be dropped into your inventory (awaiting your claim)
* **Sale day**: Go and buy more Crew Packs at the Galactic Marketplace.

### Opening Packs

A special app will go live on the Play portal/marketplace, where packs can be opened. This app will feature cool animations to make the experience more memorable. On a more practical front, this app will allow you to open multiple packs in one go by simply inputting how many you want to open.

For everyone interested in increasing their crew in Starbased, the app also comes with a toggle that allows you to insert the Crew members directly into the game! This is a huge time-saver, as otherwise, you would have to insert your crew manually, one by one, as they are NFTs, unlike your ships. So make sure you do not forget to toggle this before opening the packs!

![Crew - Faction Leader Campaign](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/68bb3023e376caa39d8f1812a8e505773064902470cf5cd9e0533d5e44d7fb4f.png)

Crew – Faction Leader Campaign

## Faction Leaders

The team has come up with the cool idea of distributing the 3 Faction Leaders to the players! This will happen through a raffle at a future date after the Crew Sale has gone live. Everyone who owns at least one set of common to legendary (so, including all 5 rarities) crew cards from a single faction will participate in the raffle for that faction’s leader. Every such set will represent a single raffle ticket.

There will be one winner for each Faction, and they will be getting:

* Anomolous Crew member – The Faction leader
* A unique (1-of-1) ship (large)
* Exclusive access to a unique (1-of-1) Tier 5 habitat on the Faction’s CSS
* Dedicated office space at The Cradle (Council of Peace space station)

The important part: Access to all these things will be revoked after the 1-year term is up, and another raffle will take place. The one thing you’ll keep is the anomalous crew member, who is no longer the faction leader. See the above image for more details!

## DAO – MVP Launch

Quite possibly, the biggest news during the Town Hall is that the DAO will go live today (Monday, July 8th)! One of the team’s developers (Yves, aka Xeanor) has temporarily patched (Web2-style) all the missing pieces so that a minimum viable version of the voting mechanics can go live **today**! Importantly, this version will forgo the on-chain mechanisms that are still part of the end-game plan for the DAO.

This “hybrid” version uses off-chain message signing to register votes (approve/reject), with the vote being stored in a (Web2) SQL database the team is hosting. This is clearly not the ideal solution, but it does allow the team to kick off the governance process today!

Besides the voting, the discourse module is also not yet up and running, and this is why the Star Atlas Discord server will get a new category of channels, all focused on facilitating Polis Improvements Proposal (PIP) discussions.

Note: Not all proposals will be deemed valid initially. The DAO has been building up an impressive treasury these last few years, and Michael shared that the DAO will first focus on that treasury and treasury management. For example, he is thinking of a proposal for Hackathon prizes.

### Roll-out

There is an event taking place on **Monday, July 8th, 18:00 UTC** on the Star Atlas Discord (right after this newsletter went out), where the Community Team and Dan Park (legal council) will discuss everything related to the Star Atlas DAO: The PIPs that will be launched, how the Temporary Council will work, the Ecosystem Fund and more!

The first 2 PIPs will be published on Monday (today), and voting will open two days later, on Wednesday, July 10th.

### First PIPs

There will be four PIPs going live first, which will lay the groundwork for what is to come:

* PIP-1: Lays the groundwork for how proposals work, how to create a proposal, discuss it, revise it, and how to vote on them.
* PIP-2: Ratifies the operations of the Star Atlas Foundation—The Cayman entity that supports the DAO.
* PIP-3: Foundation for Council (elections coming soon after)—Community Team & Dan will form the council before the council has been elected.
* PIP-4: Create an ecosystem fund—Carve out a portion of the treasury to be used exclusively for ecosystem growth. This allows community builders to propose to get a slice of that fund.

Star Atlas Summit ’24 Floor

## Star Atlas Summit

Another major unexpected reval is that the team is organizing the first ever Star Atlas conference! They named this the **Star Atlas Summit** (SAS), and it will take place during Breakpoint in Singapore. Specifically, it will take place on September 21st, on the second day of the Breakpoint conference, one floor beneath the Breakpoint main event (on the 3rd floor of the Suntec Conference building).

The best part: **The event is open to all and there is no entrance fee!** 

The team is planning a full-day of fireside chats, panels and presentations from various team members, and are looking to include DACs and IP builders as well.

This all came together last-minute so the team is working overtime to work out all of the details at the moment.

Stay tuned for more information!

## UE5 Roadmap Pivot

We’ve had a few pivots these past few years regarding (what is now) SAGE, but this Town Hall, the team announced a significant pivot to the UE5 Roadmap. The updated [live Roadmap](https://portal.productboard.com/staratlas/1-star-atlas-roadmap) will be published on July 9th, but the highlights are:

* Release 2.2 is no more. The next release is the Preseason release (2024), followed by Season 0 (2025/2026). The R2.2 items have been distributed over Preseason and Season 0, with the majority having found their home in Season 0.
* Preseason will focus on Surge or, rather, the third-person shooter mode popularized by Surge.
* Season 0 will focus on Racing, Character Progression and Customization

Besides a bunch of third-person shooter modes, you can expect the following with the Preseason release:

* Fleet Command
* ONI CSS
* Project Galia

## Project Galia

Last year, around Christmas, Brad (UE5 Engineer) and Michael shared/teased/leaked a video of Brad navigating through the galaxy and visiting various star systems. This Town Hall, we’ve learned that Brad has continued work on this, and now this module will actually see the light of day as one of the major features of the new Preseason release. As such, it has now received an official name: [Project Galia](https://youtu.be/Hfh_I4gwDGw) (check out the video)!

<YouTube id="Hfh_I4gwDGw" title="Project Galia - Early preview - WIP"  />
 

_A few notes on this video: A developer (Brad) has created most of the artwork, not an actual asset designer. It’s all placeholder stuff. The same goes for the market panes through which Brad is trading in the video. The first version will likely not enable on-chain trading like this (which would also require local markets)._

Project Galia is all about navigation through the vast galaxy, and it will form the backbone of the Star Atlas UE5 game. When it rolls out, other features, such as the ONI CSS, will likely be reachable by flying through space!

## Ship Rentals

For a while now, a 3rd party has been working on setting up ship rentals/lending for Star Atlas. This past Monday, the team integrated their work onto their devnet, and it worked!

This is great news, as this unlocks ship rentals/lending coming to Star Atlas in H2 of this year! The team will need more time, however, as they haven’t begun the work on the front-end UI just yet.

## Voluntary LP Redemption Window Closes

A bit of news that is not coming from the Town Hall: This Monday, July 8th, is the last day players can buy ATLAS using their remaining (saved) Loyalty Points. Any points not spent on that day will be automatically converted to ATLAS.

This last bit is new information, as up until now it was suggested that any points remaining would simply be lost. It’s also unclear if the team can really access your Loyalty Points, but it would be relatively simple for them to snapshot the remaining outstanding LP and acquire ATLAS for those accounts. Perhaps the team is able to reset the Loyalty Points for all players, but that would be optional, as it would not really matter anymore afterward. 

## Econ Report

The Econ team released the [second Quarterly Report](https://staratlas.com/newsroom/economic-reports/star-atlas-economic-report-2024-q2) for this year during the Town Hall event. Below, we’ve included the key highlights from the executive notes, but we, of course, recommend reading the report in its entirety!

* Daily Percentage of ATLAS emission sunk remained consistently above 100%, with a mean of 146.3%.
* Starbased ATLAS claiming participation increased by 86.8% from the Council Request for Resources program to the Loyalty Points program.
* The Star Atlas GDP grew by 6.24% over the quarter, resulting in a new annual GDP projection of $34,121,660.
* Starbased operational margins increased steadily across factions over the quarter, partially attributed to the 50% drop in mean daily network fees paid by players.
* Rome was the largest net accumulator of ATLAS, and Aephia was the largest net distributor of ATLAS.
* This quarter, ship and claim stake CPI show positive growth in ATLAS over the period.

## Sneak Peeks

Wrapping up this week’s issue, the team shared some beaty shots of the _finished_ Calico Maxhog inside the UE5 engine!
