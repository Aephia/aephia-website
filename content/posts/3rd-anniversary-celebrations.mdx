**On July 18th, Aephia Industries celebrated its [third anniversary](https://aephia.com/star-atlas/aephia-turns-three/) as a Star Atlas DAC (guild)!**

This year, we decided to treat you all to a _Knowledge Sharing Week_ as a throwback to our very [first anniversary](https://aephia.com/star-atlas/aephia-turns-one/), where we did the same!

![Aephia Anniversary Schedule 24](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/998ca6208f6288dd29cb464121d6cedb5bccf027d1c36d14bfaf48eda50ecb03.jpg)

Aephia Industries – 3rd Anniversary Schedule (2024)

We shared new Starbased guides, an interview with Michael Wagner, a live Starbased Automation session, and a Cataclysm playthrough + commentary. In addition, we created a 15-minute video where we go over the various other sources of public Star Atlas knowledge and content we produce/maintain for the community.

## Starbased Guides

Back when SAGE Labs was launched, we conceived an ambitious plan to compose a multi-part guide to help new players on their way. Unfortunately, time constraints resulted in only [Part 1](https://aephia.com/star-atlas/sage-labs-the-missing-manual-part-1/) having ever been published.

When Starbased was released, we created an [Upgrade/Migration guide](https://aephia.com/star-atlas/starbased-the-missing-manual/) (of sorts, which highlighted the various updates and improvements that Starbased added to the mix.

However, this did not really help new players. Part 1 of the SAGE Labs manual was really not helpful as the UI drastically changed with Starbased.

This past week, we finally remedied that! We created a brand new [Part 1](https://aephia.com/star-atlas/starbased-the-missing-manual-part-1/), which essentially covers the same topics as the previous manual. We also created a new, in-depth intro to the mini-game with [Part 0](https://aephia.com/star-atlas/starbased-the-missing-manual-part-0/). On top of that, we finally managed to expand the series with [Part 2](https://aephia.com/star-atlas/starbased-the-missing-manual-part-2/), which covers _mining_, _scanning_, and _crafting_.

What remains now is the last part, Part 3\. We plan to publish that one in a matter of weeks, rounding out the 4-part tutorial and offering new players a single guide that goes over 95% of the Starbased gameplay. Fortunately for us, it’s a relatively low lift as our [Upgrade Manual](https://aephia.com/star-atlas/starbased-the-missing-manual/) already contains 95% of the content. 

## Interview with Michael Wagner

Leon, aka [Metaverse Explorer](https://www.youtube.com/c/MetaVerseExplorer), has been covering Star Atlas for nearly three years but has never had the opportunity to interview the CEO, Michael Wagner, himself. That has now changed!

Leon sits down with Michael for a full hour, going over many of the macro developments, concerns, delays, future releases, and timelines! This is definitely worth watching! You can find alpha throughout, but especially towards the end ;-)

## Automation

Most know Viktor as one of Aephia’s Data Runners who created and maintains [Aephia’s Flipside Crypto dashboards](https://flipsidecrypto.xyz/Aephia/dashboards) concerning Star Atlas. But, besides being one of Aephia’s managers and a great analyst –providing our members with the latest insights every week – he is also the resident expert on all things SLY Automation! As such, he has given various training and strategy sessions for Aephians over time.

But now, especially for our anniversary, he hosted a training session that was open to all! A technical setback delayed the session one day, but this past Sunday, those attending got quickly up to speed during the 2+ hour session!

Of course, many unfortunately missed it, so Viktor recorded a more streamlined 1-hour recording for all of you who are still struggling with automation or have not yet taken the plunge.

## Cataclysm

Since our original announcement in late 2022, many community members have been asking us about our upcoming Community Game, **Cataclysm: Battle For Iris** (previously: Project Cataclysm).

We released an [updated teaser](https://youtu.be/TeSExIoueNE) video during Breakpoint and are now at a stage where we are starting our internal alpha tests! Though these tests are confined to a small collection of members from Aephia at the moment, it did present the perfect opportunity to record a playthrough with the whole team!

Valkynen (developer), Sensei Yamura (designer), and Funcracker (facilitator & host) sat down to play a game, while also going over the inception and actual gameplay.

The game is not yet Web3 enabled, and the decks of both players are similar and fixed, but that won’t prevent anyone from having a great time with the first iteration of this incredibly fun game!

## Content Overview

At Aephia, we frequently publish all kinds of Star Atlas-related knowledge using various content platforms and approaches. This past week, Viktor and Funcracker sat down to discuss some of the most impactful ones! 

Definitely worth a watch if you want to make sure you are not missing anything!
