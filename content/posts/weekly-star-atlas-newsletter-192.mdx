This past week was relatively quiet, up until the Econ Forum. Chris (VP of Game Economy) brought fresh _alpha_, including a new reveal concerning _Black Goo_, which is an upcoming UE5-only resource tied to exclusive combat components coming with SAGE C4\. The team is also weighing whether to shut down FICs ahead of C4, and hinted at major changes to game economics in this week’s Town Hall. Last, but definitely not least, a new UE5 patch rolled out that nerfed the _Profound Punaab_ and introduced several quality-of-life updates.

_Let’s dive in!_

## Econ Forum #15

Chris shared a bunch of alpha during the past [Econ Forum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9jI-FfdG_g), though not everything is set in stone just yet. Before we get to the spicy stuff, let’s start at the beginning! For starters, he went into some stats related to UE5 and Holosim.

Star Atlas – Economic Forum #15

Going over UE5:

* 516 UE5 players who gained XP in the first week (a little less, actually), which is roughly the same as the number of daily active users in Holosim (518).
* 4 players managed to prestige a human male, three other character groups reached prestige 1

Looking more into Holosim, Chris showed us the following slide:

Star Atlas – Economic Forum #15

### Black Goo

When SAGE C4 goes live later this year, a new resource will be added to the economy that will be exclusively obtainable in UE5\. It will be an in-game reward, likely awarded in a similar way as the Crew Packs in the current setup, that will be a required ingredient in a few C4 recipes. There will be special, exclusive Ship Components, related to combat, that rely on this material to be crafted. This resource is named Black Goo, and it will be exclusively available through UE5.

Initially, the team was looking into bringing this live along with the previous UE5 patch, but since the June 4th Town Hall, they changed their mind and figured it would make a lot more sense to wait for C4\. This major SAGE update will introduce hundreds of new resources and recipes, making it a natural fit from day one.

Black Goo being available only through UE5 gameplay makes this the first resource that requires skill to obtain. The team is observing the current XP mechanic in UE5 to inform their decisions regarding how much Black Goo to reward in-game.

Note: Black Goo will be tradable on the Marketplaces.

### FICS

The Econ team has been thinking hard about FICs for the last few weeks. They are considering shutting FICs down completely soon, instead of waiting for C4\. This would mean that the Loyalty Point mechanic is the only source of ATLAS emissions again, just as it was before FICs were introduced. The biggest issue with that system, which doesn’t incentivize you to get friends into the game, would return in full force as well.

In this scenario: 

* FICS can still be sold (to get rid of stock).
* 9-10M ATLAS would be added to the LP pool
* New ship recipes would be added to keep the game loop interesting

Chris asked around what people thought about this.

An alternative idea, being proposed by some community members on the spot, is to introduce a new FIC recipe that would take the other FICs as input. Chris says he is not opposed, and they even have the recipe ready. It would lead to only this new FIC asset having buy orders. They will think about it.

### **Starbases Upgrade Completion**

Another issue being discussed during the Q&A is what will happen when Factions near completing all Starbase Tier 5 upgrades, or when only SDUs remain.

Chris shared that they can only change future recipes. And indeed, every week that we go without C4, we get closer to the state where all Starbases have been leveled up.

The idea is to add 18th Starbase to each faction, and add T1 to T2 upgrade paths that will allow for infinite amounts of resources. This means T2 will never be reached, but at least people will still be able to earn ATLAS. This becomes a necessity when FICs would be removed, of course.

Star Atlas Summer – Town Hall Pt. 2

## Star Atlas Summer – Town Hall #2

This Wednesday, the second Town Hall of this Star Atlas Summer will take place (during the Atlas Brew timeslot). Like the previous Town Hall (and the next), this event will go hand-in-hand with a product release.

The team has been very tight-lipped regarding what to expect, unlike with the previous event. During the Economic Forum, Chris was the only team member to leak some details. He mentioned that we can expect a **pretty massive update to how Economics work** in Star Atlas, going so far as to call this a revolutionary change. He went on to say that we can expect news related to **lowering the cost of playing SAGE**.

This could suggest there will be news related to either AtlasNet or the Atlas Locker, but it could be something unexpected as well.

It promised to be a very interesting Town Hall, so make sure to tune in!

## UE5 Patch

The team released a small patch this past Thursday to address some of the issues and feedback they received since launching the Summer Update. One of the issues the team addressed is the Profound Punaab. Many streamers, influencers, and community members felt this little creature was simply too OP (overpowered) compared to the other species. The team has now nerfed it in response.

Below are the full patch notes for this release.

**Balance**:

* \[NERF\] Increased Profound Punaab hitboxes
