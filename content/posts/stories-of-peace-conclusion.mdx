The year 2023, or rather 2623, marked a major milestone in the history of Star Atlas! That year, the Galia Expanse celebrated [100 years of peace](https://medium.com/star-atlas/a-reflection-on-the-100th-anniversary-of-the-signature-of-the-treaty-of-peace-d237dd6af592) between the three major factions, the MUD, the ONI, and the Ustur.

You can read the official address by _Vaor Scarka_ (Ruling Secretary of the Council of Peace) to the citizens of those factions [here](https://medium.com/star-atlas/a-reflection-on-the-100th-anniversary-of-the-signature-of-the-treaty-of-peace-d237dd6af592).

To celebrate this anniversary, we organized a [short story writing competition](https://aephia.com/star-atlas/a-merry-christmas-star-atlas-writing-competition/) in December, themed the fruits of this century of peace, nicely in line with the spirit of Christmas.

The objective was to write a story that would celebrate this peace. It could be an anecdote of something that could only have happened due to the peace treaty.

A total of [12 stories](https://aephia.com/star-atlas/twelve-stories-of-peace-in-the-galia-expanse/) were submitted, and members of the Star Atlas team, under the leadership of the chief Noot, _José_ (aka _ZeSKK_) himself, spent the last few weeks reviewing each and every one of them!

And they have come to a conclusion!

> I was baffled by the Star Atlas community’s passion and writing skills! It feels reassuring to have so many talents dreaming and writing their own stories in Galia Expanse. It won’t be long before they can manifest them in reality as well.

> José, the noot of lore
