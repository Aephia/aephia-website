_Welcome to another issue of the Aephia Industries newsletter! This newsletter contains information about factions, gameplay, assets, organizations, and tokens._

## Factions

For those of you who are still undecided on which faction to pick, Star Atlas recently released two new articles for the [Ustur](https://medium.com/star-atlas/star-atlas-in-game-play-adventures-ustur-builder-c8d9936331d8) and the [ONI](https://medium.com/star-atlas/star-atlas-in-game-play-conquest-as-an-oni-fighter-ffc94bec9c97). Make sure to read these to get a glimpse on what it will be like to play within these factions. In terms of resources, those exclusive to each faction are used in crafting components based on that faction’s advantages (Ustur: hulls and thrusters, ONI: wide scanners and energy output suppression, and MUD: weaponry and warp drives). Two other [rare resources](https://play.staratlas.com/faction) can only be found in the high risk zone. Note that faction influence, as a game mechanic, is not present in the first phase of the mini game but may be present in the next.

## Gameplay

Players will have to manage food, fuel, armaments, and repair as part of the ship missions in the mini game. This system is referred to as “SCORE”, which stands for **Ship Commissions On Remote Expeditions**. Later on, specialization involves players to pick an area of expertise, such as mining or manufacturing, and earn progress through both auto and manual gameplay. In addition to specialization, there will be skill progression trees tied to specific missions. Completing missions will progress those skill trees. Experience earned outside ship missions will go to crew members to upgrade their skills and stats. Speaking of crew members, they will have traits based on the [OCEAN chart of personalities](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits). 

As for game accessibility, the mini-game and the Unreal Engine 5 version of the game will coexist for the foreseeable future and will be both supported by the team. They are also working on having the mini-game to be playable on mobile devices on different platforms. The team hopes to add this support later this year, around the time when the Phantom team releases their mobile wallet as well.

## Assets

The team is working on supporting hardware wallets where there will be a seamless transition of assets between gameplay and storage. Do keep in mind that character progress and licenses are bound to an account. Owning multiple accounts is allowed but may affect your progression since your playtime is spread across those accounts instead of just focusing on one. The “scholarship” system is possible but it is up to the owner of those assets and accounts to set terms and agreements. 

Ship production will most likely be uncapped but will instead depend on different variables such as availability of resources, production efficiency, and blueprint availability. Manufactured ships will then count towards actual total supply which will in turn affect rarity and price.

## Organizations

The team is working on launching the Star Atlas DAO for the purpose of staking POLIS, and the first phase of Ship Missions (using SCORE) in a few weeks. Afterwards they will focus on enabling voting through the DAO, and launching DAC registration which will include setting up a DAC-based DAO. Additionally, they are working on a way to allow DACs to present themselves to an audience of VC’s in order to facilitate matchmaking between the two. DAO governors can distribute ATLAS to existing stakeholders, burn the tokens to reduce supply, distribute to the Star Atlas team, or reinvest back into the economy as incentives for new players.

## Tokens

The team announced that ATLAS will have utility in the marketplace soon. As for POLIS, it will be rewarded through staking in the Star Atlas DAO, with greater rewards for those who actively engage in the voting process. There will be additional mechanics, both internal and external to the metaverse that will lead to distribution of POLIS.
