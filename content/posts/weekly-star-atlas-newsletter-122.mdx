The highlight of last week was, no doubt, the long-awaited publication of the new **roadmap**! It provides great insight into the rough order in which the team plans to release certain features to the players. Additionally, we almost had a short multiplayer stress test _test_, but it was canceled at the last minute. No, that is not an editing error. By the way, the Surge game mode sure looks interesting!

In other news, the owner of the Rainbow Phi Titan ship has been revealed, and the ship has been spotted in SAGE! And last but not least, we have the latest from Michael (CEO) on **_lending_**!

_Let’s dive in!_

Star Atlas Alive – Season 0

## Roadmap

The long-awaited [Roadmap](https://portal.productboard.com/staratlas/1-star-atlas-roadmap/tabs/2-release-2-2) is here! It seems to have been built on top of the 2022 roadmap (shared during Breakpoint that year), but it offers many more features, especially non-UE5 ones, and more details for each item!

Instead of posting a long Medium article, the team used an external service well-suited for this: [Productboard](https://www.productboard.com). This tool allows the team to easily maintain their roadmap while the players can easily browse the various milestones and features.

We posted a [dedicated article](https://aephia.com/star-atlas/star-atlas-the-road-ahead/) in which we reviewed the roadmap and compared it to the 2022 one. It’s a long read, going over each (Pre-)Season, but it may be well worth a read as it provides some additional insights and clarifications that may be helpful.

Here are a few interesting bits to give an idea of what is in there:

* The **Metaverse** starts with Season 1 – The very first metaverse feature will come with Season 1, when the game will allow players to enter other UE5 games and (player-created) UE5 projects straight from specific locations on the map. Season 6 will add the option to warp into another game/project directly.
* With season 6, **homeworlds for all species** will be added to the game. But Season 0 will already bring us **Ioki**, the home planet of the Ustur! It will be the first fully explorable planet, which allows visitors to learn more about the lore and culture of the Ustur.
* Starting with Ioki, the team will kick off the sale of **commercial spaces** and **residential habs** on the Ustur homeworld in Season 0.
* **IRIS** will come last. The rogue planet is, of course, the most end-game content, so the team will not add it before Season 8.

Clearly, there is a ton more stuff coming, and depending on what you are looking forward to most, the items that will jump out at you will be different. Do catch up on the [official roadmap](https://portal.productboard.com/staratlas/1-star-atlas-roadmap/tabs/2-release-2-2), and check out our [extensive article](https://aephia.com/star-atlas/star-atlas-the-road-ahead/) for much more detailed thoughts on everything that is coming!

### Delay

You may wonder why the roadmap was delayed, as it does not readily seem to contain any major revelations that the team may have wanted to keep under wraps a little longer. Dominic (Community Manager) shared that originally, the team was hoping to be able to share more on the future of SAGE 3D. In the end, however, that did not work out on time, and instead of delaying the roadmap further, the team decided to go with naming the feature **_Classified 3D SAGE Update_** instead for now.

Star Atlas – Surge Game Mode – MUD Base

## Surge Test

As announced during the [Town Hall in February](https://aephia.com/star-atlas/town-hall-report-february-27-2024/), the next multiplayer stress test will include a brand new game mode: _Surge_. During Surge, members of all three factions will compete in a faction-vs-faction-vs-faction third-person shooter, trying to score the most points. The exact gameplay is still unclear, but there are 3 bases that mark the “edges” of the map (you can move beyond them, but there is nothing to do) and several clearly marked areas (rings) on the map where, no doubt, a lot of the action will take place.

There are ships on the map, but those are non-functional models only. None of these ships are flyable, though, in the version online today, additional ships can be spawned.

Before launching the real stress test, where the team hopes to reach close to 2000 simultaneous players, the team plans to do a smaller-scale test to check out the game build and the Surge game mode. Unlike the full multiplayer test, this one lasts only a few hours and won’t come with rewards. Originally, the team had planned this session to take place this past Saturday, but it was canceled due to some critical bugs.

Since then, the team has released a build that seems to work for most. They are expected to announce a new attempt to test the new game mode soon, which will occur later this week.

## Lending

This past Sunday (yesterday), a few community members were chatting about lending, and it became obvious that people’s thoughts and expectations on the topic were quite different. Fortunately, Michael jumped in and shared some information, aligning everyone again. 

He shared that the team had, and still has, a conservative approach to working on DeFi features. However, over time, Michael realized that for a lending system to be considered credible by players, it would be best to offer it through the official Star Atlas website. That said, the team is _not_ working on this feature themselves. At this stage, with limited resources, they are still relying on 3rd parties. Fortunately, an external team is already working on lending, and according to Michael, they are making great progress. This may result in the feature being launched “sooner rather than later”.

He immediately followed that up by adding that he had hesitated to comment on this earlier, as it’s an external development, and they have no prior experience with this team. Also, while he thinks it is promising, it has not yet reached a stage where they can test it. In short, **_it may not come to fruition_**! 

If and when it does come through, it will be made available in the Play portal (website) and will become an “official” product. Before that becomes a reality, the team will ensure that this feature undergoes security auditing by the team and their external security partners. In addition, the team will require access to change logs on future releases. If they are going to offer it through their website, it needs to adhere to their stringent security practices.

Lastly, once the team has more clarity on the feasibility of this feature, it may be added to the roadmap.

## Titan Ship – Rainbow Phi

On Wednesday, it was revealed that long-time community member **_Virtuwul_** is the owner of the recently sold Rainbow Phi Titan ship! Days later, the ship was spotted in the wild in SAGE! As the Pearce T1 is still in the team’s possession while awaiting payment, the Phi is really the first Titan to end up in a player’s hands and the first one to partake in actual gameplay!

Virtuwul shared some additional concept art for the Rainbow Phi Titan with us, which we included below for your viewing pleasure!
