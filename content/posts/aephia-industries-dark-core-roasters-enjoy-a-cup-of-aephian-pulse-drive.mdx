To celebrate our 2nd anniversary, we are thrilled to announce a special collaboration with the coffee gurus from Dark Core Roasters!

Today, we unveil [Aephian Pulse Drive](https://darkcoreroasters.com/products/aephian-pulse-drive), a limited-edition coffee blend destined to awaken the senses of connoisseurs across the Galia Expanse!

Inspired by the coffee legacy of Aephia’s employees of old, who relied on this cherished brew to fuel their mining, refining, and ship-crafting endeavors, Aephian Pulse Drive encapsulates the essence of dedication, innovation, and unity, paying homage to the legacy of the past while soaring into the future!

Aephian Pulse Drive is a unique and limited-edition coffee brew that pays tribute to the rich heritage of Aephia Industries. It captures the essence of tradition and craftsmanship, bringing you a delightful blend of ethically sourced, hand-roasted beans from the far reaches of the universe. Carefully curated to tantalize the taste buds with deep natural tones and hints of interstellar spices, this blend emulates the original Atlas Brew but with an extra caffeine infusion.

Embrace this stellar journey and [secure your taste of history today](https://darkcoreroasters.com/products/aephian-pulse-drive)! Available for a limited time only.
