Solana Breakpoint 2023 – Star Atlas Keynote

## Breakpoint 2023

On Thursday, November 2nd, Michael appeared on stage to present his long-awaited update on Star Atlas to the world. The [keynote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9elx0ir2js) by Michael (CEO) was undoubtedly one of the most eye-catching presentations at the Solana “Breakpoint” Conference! Michael opened with a motivational speech from the movie Poolhall Junkies (2022) \[[see original scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U18GoAy2nNQ)\] as a way of describing the _past_ & the _now_, both of the Solana ecosystem and of Star Atlas, emboldening those listening.

He then expanded on a few different aspects of Star Atlas development:

* UE5 Showroom
* Massive Multiplayer in UE5
* SAGE Labs
* DACs
* Mobile Companion App
* Crew (Packs)

Below, we go over these one by one.

### Showroom R2.2

Michael briefly summarized what is currently available on the Epic Games Store before going deeper into what is coming with (Pre-)Release 2.2 next year, specifically:

* On-chain career progression – Specifically: Ship configuration, ship mastery & XP systems
* Multiplayer combat racing – You can switch between tractor beam & weapons to pickup up ammo, health, or shields, or take out opponents, respectively
* Character & Vehicle skins

We did not really learn anything new here, but the [accompanying video](https://youtu.be/uSGMlTxhOFc) sure looked finger-licking good!

### Massive Multiplayer

Michael then introduced Rashid Mansoor (Co-founder & CEO of MetaGravity) to the stage to talk about their work to get up to 30k players (so far) into a single world for Star Atlas.

Rashid explained that they did not embrace the Spatial Partitioning scheme, where a map is divided into smaller segments, but instead went with a technique they dubbed Causal Partitioning. Then he showed a [video](https://youtu.be/c9elx0ir2js?feature=shared&t=1191) where 30k simulated players navigated the Showroom map.

### SAGE Starbased

Michael next switched to SAGE, where he highlighted the fully on-chain nature of this Grand Strategy game. This game is fully on-chain and built using seven distinct Solana programs. While playing the game, data is read and written to the chain in real time.

Of course, Michael highlighted the impressive metrics achieved on-chain, such as:

* 23.7 million transactions in the first month
* Average of 2 million transactions per day (atm)
* 10-15% of daily Solana network transaction volume
* 2000 daily active users (DAU)
* 10k unique wallet connections through time

Then, the moment everyone was waiting for, Michael looked at the near future and discussed SAGE Starbased. It will have a **real economy**, **3D graphics**, and be **universally accessible** through the browser.

Of course, he did show a pretty [cool video](https://youtu.be/c9elx0ir2js?feature=shared&t=1490) showing the current state of the engine when zooming in on a single-star system.

### DAC Registration

DAC registration is coming out soon, and Michael spent a short moment going over the initial feature set while showing off a [video that shows off some of the UI](https://youtu.be/c9elx0ir2js?feature=shared&t=1696).

### Co-creation with the Community

Next up, Michael expressed the team’s desire to co-create this universe with the community. This is a reason for taking on the challenge of creating on the blockchain. It allows for composability.

He then highlighted both the IP Program and the Developer Program, reviewing some examples and metrics, as seen below.

Star Atlas – Breakpoint Presentation – Developer Program Participants

Though technically not part of either program, Michael took the time to spotlight fellow community member Arktype’s _Atlas Grace_ initiative. Arktype donates rewards generated by Star Atlas assets to various charities around the globe.

### Mobile Companion App

Michael briefly explained the function and goal of the upcoming mobile companion app. You can select a single crew member from your wallet (not currently employed in SAGE or elsewhere) and train them through walking, running, or cycling in the real world.

![Star Atlas - Breakpoint Presentation - Companion App](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/e00fd1d9696b24197fcaa4f0071fcfc80d7e5ecbf796ddc1afd20572fb47b7f3.png)

Of course, Michael had another [short and slick video](https://youtu.be/c9elx0ir2js?feature=shared&t=2029) up his sleeve to sell this app!

<YouTube id="c9elx0ir2js" title="Breakpoint 2023: Star Atlas Session" caption="Star Atlas – Breakpoint Presentation – Companion App" />
 

### Crew

Crew recruitment is coming in Q1 2024 when the team will start selling Crew packs. Each pack will contain five crew members of varying rarity. Each crew member will have procedurally generated traits and a unique backstory! Besides playing a key role in SAGE and Star Atlas, these crew cards will also be used as PFPs in the Star Atlas ecosystem.

![Star Atlas - Breakpoint Presentation - Crew Packs](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/24bf53b4bf143c6036828e853326d88d3da55a2fb90819e8cb902f0b102aaa51.png)

The team will also drop crew members to ship-holders based on a snapshot that will be taken shortly before. The team will likely drop the exact amount of crew members; it is unlikely they will round up to a full (5-card) character pack.

Of course, the team had a [video prepared](https://youtu.be/c9elx0ir2js?feature=shared&t=2127) to show off the design of the upcoming Crew Packs as well.

### Conclusion

Already a good few minutes over his allotted time, Michael wrapped up by repeating that the team is not building siloed product verticals silos. Instead, they work on an _interconnected and interwoven universe_.

> We are building a new economy, a digital nation-state, powered by the people. All of this is only possible because of our game logic on Solana, with composability and a shared network state.

> Michael (CEO)

## Golden Ticket Raffle

The drawing of the winners of the very first Golden Ticket raffle took place on Friday last week. It was an exciting event, with a new winner drawn every minute for a good bit of time. The biggest prizes came, of course, at the very end.

In total, a little over 950k tickets were submitted, with several whales submitting over 100k each. It was, therefore, no surprise that the big ticket items primarily ended up with them. You can check the Hedgehog website for a [complete overview of all the winners](https://hedgehog.markets/star-atlas/AhEnTtRtXeygz8ShcAhVYy1xWAk8heDQMruxD2nEmaC4).

Breakpoint ’23 Community Meetup – Group shot

## Breakpoint Meetup

On Tuesday, October 31st, the community hosted a meetup where team members, community members, and other interested parties could meet and hang out. 

After a short delay, the dinner cruise departed with everyone (minus one participant due to COVID) on board and enjoyed some beautiful sights from Amsterdam at night while enjoying a tasty Indonesian buffet. During this time, some swag was handed out, with a highlight being custom-made Aephia-branded shot glasses, which were immediately filled with either “Stroopwafel” liqueur or “Dropshot” (for those who dared), adding some typical Dutch flavors to the palette.

Breakpoint ’23 Community Meetup – Good times were had

After the boat had docked, a group picture (see above) was taken in rainy Amsterdam before everyone took off to a nearby cafe, where they enjoyed each other’s company, a few drinks, and many a good conversation. While there, the group swelled from 40 to about 75 participants.

After the cafe closed at 23:30, most folks went home, but some found other venues to continue the good vibes in smaller groups!

![SAGE Labs - Experimental Mode toggle](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/cc0b30ee978b7c687479f5d89a97338695fbdbc611271312780c5be38c0d93cb.png)

## SAGE Labs – Combat Easter Egg

If you head to SAGE Labs and toggle the new _Experimental Mode_ that can be found in the Settings menu (click the Cog in the header next to the Atlas Fee Payer, aka Atlas Prime), a new world opens!

Every sector now shows a fictional list of what a combat interface may look like. The faction of all fleets present are randomly assigned a faction, and if you have an undocked fleet, you can initiate combat and get a feel for what that is like.

![SAGE Labs - Experimental Mode - Combat Simulation](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/40a2d1a9e7936a5438fa5b13b57d1c7afad094191dcbf820458a9dc010b50894.png)

SAGE Labs – Experimental Mode – Combat Simulation

Note that there is **no actual combat**! It’s purely fictional, and damage numbers and the outcome are fixed. It merely shows off a new potential SAGE Labs interface for combat. Observe that exchanging fire also leads to both parties accumulating XP (as seen in the screenshot above).

However, it is interesting to note that the actual fleet names are used, and all of the fleets shown are actually in that sector.

_That’s a wrap for this week! Until the next!_
