The YGG Summit and Community meetup were a total blast! For those at home, the 3rd week of the Golden Carnival was probably their highlight for last week. That said, for those more politically inclined, the Atlas Brew with the Council and the launch of the DAO Knowledge Base may have stolen the show.

_Let’s dive right in!_

Star Atlas DAO – The Legislative Process \[Current version\]

## DAO – Council

Last Wednesday, during the Atlas Brew, the Council unveiled the [DAO Knowledge Base](https://star-atlas-dao.gitbook.io/knowledge-base) website. Their goal is to grow this website into the only compendium of DAO knowledge anyone needs if they want to learn more about the Star Atlas DAO (ecosystem). At present, it offers detailed insights into the DAO’s structure, history, publications, legislative process, and PIP requirements. It also contains references and links to all previously published Medium articles (by the team) and PDFs.

For those of you interested in launching a proposal of your own, two sections are of interest:

* [The Legislative Process](https://star-atlas-dao.gitbook.io/knowledge-base/governance/the-legislative-process) (aka _PIP Lifecycle_)
* [PIP Structure & Requirements](https://star-atlas-dao.gitbook.io/knowledge-base/governance/creating-a-proposal)

### Legislative Process

The Council has refined the steps a POLIS Improvement Proposal (PIP) needs to follow, from inception (ideation) to approval (or rejection). This [section](https://star-atlas-dao.gitbook.io/knowledge-base/governance/the-legislative-process) guides you through the updated process, breaking down each stage and explaining what is required and who is responsible for that step.

### PIP Structure & Requirements

The [Creating a PIP page](https://star-atlas-dao.gitbook.io/knowledge-base/governance/creating-a-proposal) is essential reading for any aspiring proposal creator! It outlines the updated PIP structure and requirements, offering clear guidance to ensure your submission meets the DAO’s standards. Additional clarification, considerations, and tips can be found at the bottom!

It also contains a [subpage](https://star-atlas-dao.gitbook.io/knowledge-base/governance/creating-a-proposal/pip-requirements) that outlines the rules a PIP must adhere to for it to be allowed to pass through the legislative process. This list is incomplete and will be expanded as the Council reviews the various proposals.

If you want to rewatch the Council’s presentation / AMA, check out the [Brew’s recording](https://www.youtube.com/live/HUxIsZmJc5c?si=0rGux0MPYdO1wCXQ&t=1321) (it starts 22 minutes in, as that is when the Council segment kicks off).

This week, the most expensive ship available in the Golden Carnival, the Fimbul BYOS Tankship, found its way into the hands of community member _Ritor_.

YGG Summit 2024 – Day 4 – Panel with Michael Wagner (Star Atlas)

## YGG Summit

[Last week](https://aephia.com/star-atlas/weekly-star-atlas-newsletter-156/), we reported on Michael’s tour through Southeast Asia. This past week was all about the YGG Summit, where the team had a booth, a Surge playable demo on laptops, and a Surge tournament. In addition, Michael joined a panel on day 4, where he joined a discussion on Web3 game challenges.

You can check the [live recording on X](https://x.com/i/broadcasts/1BdGYEovAlNGX), it starts at the 4h21m mark.

The Surge demo stations and tournament were a huge success, with the team seeing their booth being packed most of the time. The team and community members [shared](https://x.com/AnekoGameFi/status/1859874321549922316) various [posts](https://x.com/AnekoGameFi/status/1860327523965632878) on [X](https://x.com/masterkamote_/status/1860212185370361880) to demonstrate the good times both had!

## UE5 Testing

This past Tuesday, the Community Team sent out a request for testers for a new UE5 build:

> Hey everyone, we’re looking for 10-12 community members to playtest an early UE5 Star Atlas build over the next couple weeks. Selection will be based on your standing in the community and gaming experience. Testers will be chosen in 24 hours.

The window of opportunity to sign up has closed. Nevertheless, this marks an important milestone in the team’s UE5 development!

## Philippines Community Meetup

Coinciding with the YGG Summit, the Star Atlas community hosted a meetup in Manila on the 21st of November. It was a [great success](https://x.com/masterkamote_/status/1859769851042202075?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1859769851042202075%7Ctwgr%5Ed2fa0a3cf651f7d5123ce52bef1d879aaf18a2db%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Faephia.com%2Fwp-admin%2Fpost.php%3Fpost%3D15667action%3Dedit) with many community members meeting each other for the first time! From the team, both Michael and Miguel (Director of Growth) were present.
