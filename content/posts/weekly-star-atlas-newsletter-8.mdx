## News

Star Atlas just updated their [Roadmap Report](https://staratlas.notion.site/Roadmap-Report-8e75d87c5b7b4a67afb4fd776d6c3176) with a more detailed overview of the current state of SCORE. Additionally, Michael Wagner, the CEO, provided a list of areas that they are currently focusing on: 
- Smart contracts for staking should be completed this week - then they will enter into the audit phase
- Wireframes for the frontend have been completed.
- The Webdev team is working on general UI implementation.
- High-res UI in progress and the dev team will implement a UI Kit upon completion.
- Governance contracts and no-code deployment framework will take a bit longer - current implementation is as an EVM compatible version on Solana. They are waiting for Rust native. Also pending legal on DAO structure rollover.

## Staking

For POLIS, there will be 4 separate staking pools with durations between 6 months and 36 months. As for ATLAS, they will introduce separate staking functionality for ATLAS at a later date. This will not be tied to the DAO, and will have a separate set of advantages/benefits across the marketplace, alongside emissions. The longer you stake, the more rewards you earn.

## Assets

The team confirmed that there will be another batch of ships that will be up for sale as we approach the launch of SCORE. 

Moving to the topic of land, they confirmed that land should be accessible to all and will be similar to the price tiers of ships where there will be varying price points.
