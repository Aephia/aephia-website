## News

Perhaps, the biggest news this week is the further delay of SCORE, which is now targeted for December 9 to 17. For complete details on dates, don’t forget to check the [Star Atlas public roadmap hosted on Notion](https://staratlas.notion.site/staratlas/72cb710bbd894cd8819bde948e42ac31?v=5c5cca97579e4cd79089362bf03e55b1). This news was accompanied by a [Tweet](https://twitter.com/staratlas/status/1459305161889918986) teasing what seems to be the UI. Note that the numbers shown are just placeholders and do not represent any actual value.

## Gameplay

The initial Unreal Engine 5 version of the game, targeted for Q1 2022, is already in the demo and testing phase. They, along with Sperasoft, have been working on this in the past 3 months.

## Community

A [Bloomberg press-release](https://www.bloomberg.com/press-releases/2021-11-12/record-deal-in-the-world-of-nft-gaming-the-club-spends-3-million-on-nft-ships-from-the-star-atlas-game) came out disclosing a private deal between Star Atlas team and one of the guilds (“The Club”) where for $3 million the guild got assets at tranche 1 pricing (those prices are almost impossible to get on thought after ships), including 12 yet unreleased commander ships. This put many community members who followed Star Atlas development for months on edge, because it is seen as contradictory to “Power to the people!” approach the team advertised, especially given an impression that the deal decreased supply of tranche 1 pricing for the public sale.

## Recruitment

The Star Atlas team is rapidly growing in terms of manpower. At the moment, there are around 175 employees. They have a targeted number of 400 to 500 people around the same time next year. If you or someone you know wants to be part of a project this ambitious, reach out to Kelsey Thompson (Crypto Amore) in the Star Atlas Discord or send an email to [jobs@staratlas.com](mailto:jobs@staratlas.com).
