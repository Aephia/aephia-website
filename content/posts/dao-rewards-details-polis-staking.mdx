The Star Atlas CEO shared some details about the upcoming staking of the POLIS token in the DAO: “The structure is separate from NFT asset yields. So you can’t assume the same rates of return (as NFT ship mission rewards). It will be highly variable depending on the number of people that participate in staking and governance. Also, the hierarchy of DAOs will all have disparate return profiles, depending on many variables. Notably, the economy of a particular faction or region, and well as the general growth of GDP within the metaverse.

There will be base emission yields, which change based on participation. But the cost components inside the metaverse are captured by the master DAO. To that end, the returns in the master DAO will increase as the users and activity inside the metaverse expands.”
