In an [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ief7G1DlIoI&t=631s) with the [Decentralized News Network](https://medium.com/@dnnmedia) Michael Wagner, CEO of Star Atlas, talked about the future plans regarding guild communication and coordination within Star Atlas and their discord:

“One of the additional roles that we’re hiring for right now is the head of DAC (decentralized autonomous corporations, the Star Atlas term for guilds) relations. The general idea is, that we have a single point of contact where all guilds can communicate and then we start to coordinate things like marketing, exposure, tool-sets and development.”
