The metagenic stone beings comprise the Tufa faction and when one of them take the shape of this small fighter ship they identify as a Feist. No longer can one feel safe casually navigating an asteroid field because lurking in plain sight is a potential ambush vehicle collecting its raw power for a brutal sneak attack. Living, sentient rock formations combine discarded mining tech into a powerful, blitz-styled combat platform with local stone material shifting camouflage abilities. Despite the exotic blend of industrial technologies with breathing non-organics, the Tufa Feist is a surprisingly comfortable vessel to take on many challenges in an variety of deep space adventures.

### Tufa Ships

The Tufa Feist is made by a faction of metagenic creatures, also known as the “scourge of the cataclysm”. They are based in the high risk zone and are one of the three minor factions in Star Atlas. Tufa ships combine civilian, stealth, and military technologies with “exotic” technology.

To produce a ship like the Tufa Feist, resources are needed from all faction regions of Star Atlas. In addition, some exotic high risk zone locked materials.

A complete overview of all known ship manufacturers of the Star Atlas metaverse can be found in our infographic:

### A fully equipped Generation 1 model

Remember that all ships bought through the GAO ([Galactic Asset Offering](https://staratlaswiki.org/wiki/GAO)), are delivered fully loaded. In later game stages, new ships will be barebone and only limited components are bespoke and fixed. So – you’re not only getting a Generation 1 model, but you’re also getting more bang for your buck!

However, the ships will still be fully customizable. All the various modules can be changed/sold as needed as confirmed by Bunthius (Star Atlas CPO): “_The plan right now is that all GAO ships come with filled crew/component/module slots. You’ll be able to un-slot all these GAO filler items and sell them, and respec individually._”

### Earning potential of the Tufa Feist

If you’re wondering how much you can earn with your Tufa Feist in Star Atlas, here are some facts:

Before Star Atlas releases the full game in the Unreal 5 engine, all players have the opportunity to participate in the browser game (called SCORE) with their ship NFTs to generate revenue (learn all the details about the [Star Atlas mini game](https://aephia.com/star-atlas/what-is-the-star-atlas-mini-game-score/) in our guide).

If the player provides his ship to his faction (ONI, MUD or Ustur), he will receive ATLAS, the in-game currency of Star Atlas, in return. This amount is measured by the **VWAP** (the “volume weighted average price” at which the ship was offered in the Galactic Asset Offering) of your ships. For the Tufa Feist, the VWAP is **$795** USDC.

So if you have the opportunity to buy this ship at a price below the VWAP, this could be a good deal for you (of course no financial or ship advice).
