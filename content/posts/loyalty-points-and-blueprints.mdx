As the Star Atlas team published some more information about ship manufacturing and ship blueprints, players already speculate about somewhat of a blueprint skill tree.

Chypto shared some light on the team’s approach on Discord: “For blueprint unlocks, I am leaning towards a different system where players spend loyalty points and each blueprint has a set cost. A player can choose to rush the cheap ones or save up for something more akin to their play style or specialization. Keynote, loyalty points are earned via gameplay, not purchased. I also don’t think blueprints should be tradeable. Some blueprints could also be earned/found via others means. This would result in players all having different blueprints unlocked which is the goal.

We definitely want to encourage specialization. Assuming we do allow a player to unlock all the blueprints, that would be scaled to be a very long-term goal. There will be blueprints or unlocks associated with modifications. There will likely be research and or skill-based unlocks separate from blueprint unlocks.”
