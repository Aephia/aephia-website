* 7+ Days enlisted: Suntiger Pearce X4 Skin
* 150+ Days enlisted: RedX-IV Pearce X4 Skin
* 300+ Days enlisted: Blue Tigu Pearce X4 Skin

## SAGE

**Big release today:** [The SAGE Game Manual](https://staratlas.com/newsroom/game-manuals/sage-game-manual-part-2-game-structure) (Big shout-out to Chip & Mo!)

> _SAGE is absolutely leading-edge, pioneering, on-chain game design._
> _– Michael_

People will be able to build 3rd party services for the 6 programs that power SAGE on-chain.

The team is now targeting **February** for the devnet launch. However, it will likely be limited and might not contain all the announced functionality.

## Showroom R2

**Big release today:** R2 will be released on the Epic Game Store right after the Joni Awards wrap-up!

Michael mentioned some of the things we can expect from this release:

* Character selections & Skin selection
* Two different _Time trial_ courses
* Dogfighting arena (PvE)
* Multiplayer support is there, but still very buggy.  
Good to know: Multiplayer sessions are Peer-2-per hosted experiences (no servers, players are hosting)

The upcoming R2.1 will bring:

* Upgrade to Unreal Engine 5.1 (allows for larger maps)
* Adding the train (lobby of sorts). The first arrival in the Showroom will then drop you at the Train station.
* Group Chat & Proximity Voice Chat
* A possibility that Ground racing may be added

> _Major thank you to the community for being with us through the thick and thin \[of this year\]!_
