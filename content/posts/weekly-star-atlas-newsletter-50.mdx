_Welcome to our 50th newsletter on Star Atlas! This is a weekly newsletter, published by Aephia Industries, that is focused entirely on Star Atlas. Here we try to aggregate all the newsworthy tidbits that were dropped by the team throughout the past week._

The past week was light on new reveals and -as outlined in the [previous issue](https://intel.aephia.com/newsletters/weekly-star-atlas-newsletter-49/)- the team did not provide us with an update on their progress either. As a quick recap: In the last [issue of the Atlas Star (#11)](https://medium.com/star-atlas/the-atlas-star-issue-11-f3e4d0e6134f) the team laid out a new rotating, 3-week publication schedule that would see the team share either
- a new issue of the Atlas Star newsletter,
- a Townhall on Discord, or
- a major content release

on any given week. Though the team did not refer to it as such, last week presumably saw a "major" content drop with the roll-out of the first official patch for the Volant Studio Showroom!

## Showroom R1 - Ledger Support

Besides an attempt to squish the RPC bug that was mentioned last week, the real meat of the first-ever Showroom patch is the added support for Ledger hardware wallets! During the latest 426Live (or really, even before that) the team shared that support would not be there upon the first release, and might take a while to build in. It looks like they found a way to roll out support much faster than they anticipated, however, with this update coming out only 2 weeks after the official launch event.

## SCREAM - Testing phase

Chip (Game Systems Designer) shared some information on the upcoming release of SCREAM later this year. The team is planning to first release a test-only version, before rolling out the real thing. This means that later this year they will release a "*condensed playable version for ****testing**** without economic loops turned on yet*", in Chip's words. The plan is to incrementally build from there, up to the full version v0 (and beyond) in the new year.

As the smart contracts used for SCREAM are on a whole other level compared to the programs the team has rolled out before, it's all the more important to have a proper alpha test, before rolling the game out to everyone. As there is no real value associated with transactions, this also allows them to put something in our hands this year.

There is still too much work to be done to have a full release of SCREAM v0 in 2022. Doing it this way allows the team to put something in the hands of the community before the clock strikes 12 at midnight on December 31st.

On a final note, Chip stated that SCORE emissions would continue uninterrupted during the SCREAM testing phase.
