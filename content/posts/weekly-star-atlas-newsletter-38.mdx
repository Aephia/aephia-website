## 426Live

Last week's main event was no doubt the 426Live event hosted by the team. During COPA, Michael Wagner (CEO) announced there were 6 projects that would see a release in 4-6 weeks, and of those six projects, four indeed saw their release during this first 426Live event.

We published a more [in-depth article](https://aephia.com/star-atlas/426love/), but for now, we'll go into the 4 releases, and provide links to more in-depth articles, both official ones, and ones we published right after the event concluded.

## Galactic Marketplace v2

The new Marketplace was rolled out shortly after the 426Live event concluded, delivering an experience that was rebuilt from the ground up visually, and more importantly on the blockchain as well.

The most important features are:
- No more claiming/settling of orders - Your purchases appear in your wallet instantly
- No more Central Limit Order Book (CLOB) - Which should prevent people from trying to buy a "buy"-order
- Looks more like an Auction House, known to gamers from various MMOs

## StarPath

The team released their referral program, shortly after the marketplace went live. This program intends to incentivize the community by rewarding them for bringing new players into the ecosystem.

Everyone can register to get a referral link, which -when used by someone who connects their wallet to the website- will automatically connect that person with the account that created the link.

If people make purchases from Star Atlas directly, then the person who referred them will earn Prosperity Marks. Once someone has earned enough of these, they can choose to exchange them for Star Atlas ships.

## DAO Portal & POLIS Locker

At 426Live, Michael described what DAO governance will bring to Star Atlas and its community. He went through what proposals and voting would look like in the near future (when that will be released) and zoomed in on the POLIS Locker that launched simultaneously with the portal as its first feature.
## POLIS Locker

The POLIS Locker is now open for everyone to stake their POLIS. It can be locked anywhere between 2 weeks to 5 years (there are 10 locking duration options to select from).

On August 1st a snapshot will be taken, after which the daily rewards (in POLIS) will start dropping from August 2nd onwards.

## Hardware partnership with iBUYPOWER

Early on during the 426Live event, the team announced a new partnership, concerning PC hardware. iBUYPOWER - known for sponsoring the exclusive Star Atlas branded PC during COPA - will start selling limited edition PCs, headsets and desk pads.

First, though, they want to know if there is enough interest. To that end, they launched an [online form](https://ibuypower.com/community/partners/star-atlas) where people can select the product bundle they would like to acquire. The next step will be spinning up production, starting in North America, with other regions following two weeks later (provided there was enough interest).

## #StarAtlasSummer

The team announced that it would host more 426Live events in the near future, during the #StarAtlasSummer. The next one was announced as coming in 4-6 weeks, so we'll have to wait and see how that will pan out. If all goes well, the Showroom is next on the list to be released, though Michael confirmed the first issue of the Graphic Novel is already complete as well. The team is primarily concerning themselves with getting the distribution set up.

## Other News

Michael shared this week that there are currently 7 external studios working on Star Atlas. These studios are working/helping with:
- 3D asset for SCREAM (WebGL)
- Character/vehicle concept & creation (surface work & modelling)
- Vehicle & props production
- Audio & music production
- Specific Unreal Engine development engineering
- Material library & technical art
- Showroom (Sperasoft)

## Progress Updates

There were few progress updates this week, with the conclusion of the Marketplace & DAO Portal. The Showroom is still getting some additional polishing, whereas the team behind SCREAM reported almost no changes compared to the prior week, with the exception of the Web team busy building the *Hangar UI.﻿*

## Ships

Together with the marketplace, the team released the Fimbul BYOS Tankship, which is a legendary, commander-class fighter that resembles.. an actual seafaring ship 🚢
