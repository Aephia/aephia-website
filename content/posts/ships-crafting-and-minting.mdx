Star Atlas CEO, Michael Wagner, mentioned that there will be no further mints for existing ships. “We don’t have any immediate plans to mint any more. My suspicion is that we will start creating larger mints of new ships as the player base grows”.

Also, with regards to crafting, based on the current roadmap, Michael said that “it’s possible that players will be able to craft early ship release NFTs based on blueprints at some point next year”. However, this is not expected to be ready until the end of the year.
