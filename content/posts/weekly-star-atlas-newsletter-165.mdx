## Roadmap 2025 Video

Dominic (Community Manager) published [a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpGbzqEIovI) last week where he goes over the roadmap for 2025, particularly the first half. Though it does not contain new information, it’s a nice and short recap of what to expect!

During the Atlas Brew, Santi (Director of Community & Ecosystem) shared that the team plans to publish regular updates through Dominic’s video channel on YouTube, so you may want to subscribe to ensure you are staying up to date. Of course, we’ll make sure to share the best with you through this newsletter as well.

Star Atlas – Golden Carnival 2024 – Schedule

## Golden Carnival

The last 4-week cycle kicked off a week ago, and the [last Pearce & Calico sponsored week](https://staratlas.hedgehog.markets/star-atlas/2tzJoxfhHzFi2qYuKGmssBVsgRPZnEQZtjQYJ68ts5Mv) of this season saw a total of 2,368,227 tickets submitted. This past Friday, the 199 prizes found their way to the lucky ones!

Meanwhile, Week 14, a [Busan and Ogrika-sponsored week](https://staratlas.hedgehog.markets/star-atlas/BNB8wwoNGSSHSWHf6ew6xW2awiDhjhs3sNgik134EcDf) has opened up! Two weeks from now, the Golden Carnival will conclude with a final Mega Week, which has been dubbed “Mega Mystery Week” by the team.

### “Leaderboard”

Aephia’s Data Runners created a [new dashboard](https://flipsidecrypto.xyz/Aephia/star-atlas---gameplay-analytics-7pEAEk) showing off the biggest winners (and losers) of the Golden Carnival (so far). In a new Leaderboard table (on the _Golden_ _Carnival_ tab), you can view, per wallet, the total cost of the tickets submitted compared to the cumulative value of the winnings.

If you are curious if participating has been profitable for you, you can enter your wallet address there and have a look!

## News Bits

Lastly, here are a few small tidbits to wrap up the week:

* The [anticipated](https://aephia.com/star-atlas/weekly-star-atlas-newsletter-164/) SDU Install Timer change did not come to fruition last week. The team did not mention this in their communications, so it is unclear when they plan to enact this update.
* Danny (CPO) mentioned in the new, open Foundation Room that combat will consist of ship-vs-ship and ship-vs-starbase only. Claim Stakes and planets won’t be attackable at this first stage. However, when a Starbase is destroyed, all Claim Stakes in that system will be returned to their owners, alongside a portion of the materials used to build the various buildings therein. You won’t get back the full amount, so you better defend those Starbases!
