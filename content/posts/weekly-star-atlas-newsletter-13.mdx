## Announcements

The [Star Atlas: Official Roadmap](https://staratlas.notion.site/staratlas/72cb710bbd894cd8819bde948e42ac31?v=e04635a9f986479ba7db0ac67ba2b3df) has been updated on all the features and components that the team is heavily working on.

## Assets

A total of 51 ships will be released this year. The first ship will be released on February 3 and this will be the Fimbul XXS and will cost $15. The team is expecting to release a new ship every one to two weeks. 

There will be three titan ships that will be released via a reverse Dutch Auction mechanism:
- Pearce T1 - Titan Fighter
- Fimbul ECOS Superphoenix - Titan Bomber
- Bussan The Last Stand mk VIII - Titan Fighter

Unlike the initial wave of GAO ships that was accompanied by a brochure, this next wave of ships does not yet have a brochure tied to it.

## POLIS DAO

Michael’s estimated launch for the POLIS DAO is still in February. He mentioned a couple of concerns in determining vote weight that lead to delays, namely:

- People tend to stake multiple times.
- People will want to re-stake their POLIS emissions back into the contract.
- Knowing people will stake multiple times, the team anticipated difficulties with accurately measuring vote weight. So they are now implementing changes, which will lead to a modest delay.

## CREAM v0

For this module the team is working with multiple squads on:
- mining & extraction
- crafting & recipes
- space exploration feature (allowing  ships to be used in a different way than just putting them into SCORE)

CREAM is expected to launch in July.

## Development

The team wanted to remind everyone that a lot of the visuals they shared and will be sharing are subject to change. Additionally, they shared the phases that they are practicing:
- discovery: talk about what the project is, what it should be doing
- exploration: wireframes, prototyping
- validation: use prototypes and community feedback to help the team understand how we use those features
- Production

Because of this, target dates have been removed from the roadmap. Going forward, they will inform us on the phase the project is in. Before releasing any dates, they will follow the process of the dev-workflow and then share the confirmed date.

## Gameplay

In the showroom module, you can connect your Solana wallet of choice to summon your assets on their respective landing pads.
