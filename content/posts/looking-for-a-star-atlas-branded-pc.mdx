### The Procedure

Now, in order to pull this off, there will need to be enough people who express their interest in this. For that purpose, an [“Interest Registration” form](https://ibuypower.com/community/partners/star-atlas) was published today, where you can share your details.

If enough people are interested, then pre-orders will open up in North America first. Two weeks after that, pre-orders will open up all over the world, in areas where sufficient interest has been expressed.

Once the minimum amount of pre-orders has been received, the team will advance to production. iBUYPOWER expects it could take 10–12 weeks to fulfill all orders, as there are still supply shortages of PC components.

### Limited Edition

The PC will be a numbered, limited edition item that will never be recreated again. Once pre-orders open up, the items will be sold on a first-come, first-serve basis. The iBUYPOWER team will make sure allocations are spread out over the world, so North Americans won’t be able to buy up the total supply.
