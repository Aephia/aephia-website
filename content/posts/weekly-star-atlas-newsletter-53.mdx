_Welcome to our 53rd newsletter on Star Atlas! This is a weekly newsletter, published by Aephia Industries, that is focused entirely on Star Atlas. Here we try to aggregate all the newsworthy tidbits that were dropped by the team throughout the past week._

---

This week's newsletter finds you one day later than usual, as we felt we could not publish a version that would not include yesterday's massive reveal. It's been an exciting few days, with the team presenting both a demo of their upcoming Showroom R2 (pre-release 2) on Friday (the 4th) and Michael (CEO) giving a 20+ minute keynote on Monday (the 7th).

As a result, this has become quite an information-heavy issue. So, please sit down, grab a drink and enjoy the reveals!

## Community Meetups

There have been some pretty big community meetups going on last week, with the Quimera guild [hosting](https://twitter.com/WeAreStarAtlas/status/1588916312256188418) their first-ever Star Atlas conference in Madrid, Spain. More than 60 people attended this community-organized event, some of whom flew in from as far as Mexico. As a cherry on top, there was a special appearance by Santi (Community Director) and remote [congratulations](https://twitter.com/staratlasperu/status/1589236449291141120?s=20&t=Cq6bp29dCwrC23AjpOGzoA) from the team.

Next to that, while in Lisbon (Portugal), about 18 community members gathered to meet each other and the team (11 of them!) for the first time! It was a lovely evening where folks were enjoying each other's company, casual conversation, a few beers, and dinner together!

## Solana Games Day

On November 4th, the team presented a 45-minute showcase of their upcoming Volant Studio Showroom R2 during the Solana Games Day. It's safe to say that the team blew people away with what they were showing. The reactions from the audience and streamers were overwhelmingly positive.

During the last Townhall, Michael first announced that (PvE) dogfighting would come to R2, and less than a week later they demoed this mode with the help of a group of e-sports gamers.

There are [several](https://twitter.com/WeAreStarAtlas/status/1588608072205107200?s=20&t=Cq6bp29dCwrC23AjpOGzoA) [tweets](https://twitter.com/WeAreStarAtlas/status/1588608073924775936?s=20&t=Cq6bp29dCwrC23AjpOGzoA) worth checking out if you want to see some footage shot during the day!

Note: See the [previous newsletter](https://intel.aephia.com/newsletters/weekly-star-atlas-newsletter-52/) for more information on what R2 will bring besides these game modes.

## Breakpoint Keynote

The demo was truly amazing, but that was not all that the team had prepared. On Monday November 7th, Michael presented a 24-minute keynote that you can watch in its entirety below:

<YouTube id="mozkuqEMd3w" title="Breakpoint 2022: State of Star Atlas" caption="Breakpoint 2022: State of Star Atlas" />

Michael kicked off by stating that there were two key things that he wanted to demonstrate with his presentation:
1. That Star Atlas truly is the next generation of gaming; not just in Web3, but across the entire games industry
2. That the concept of Star Atlas is significantly larger than that of "just" a videogame; With its open architecture and permissionless on-chain game design, the team is building a gaming ecosystem that others can build upon

He followed up on that by sharing that ATMTA is focusing its efforts primarily on 3 core verticals of business: Gaming Experiences, Infrastructure & Architecture, and a Marketplace.
## Fuzzy Lemur

Talking about the infrastructure part, Michael announced *Fuzzy Lemur*, a [Solana] Blockchain Indexing Service built by the team, allowing them to bypass RPC nodes and get their data directly from the source.

Early analysis shows that they are able to receive state changes from the validators in as little as 16ms, with median speeds being 215ms, making it the fastest indexer in the industry at this point in time.

Getting these interactions as fast as possible is important as the team plans to use the blockchain as their "game server(s)".

## UE5: New Roadmap

Perhaps the biggest news on Monday was the unveiling of the full, multi-year roadmap for the Unreal Engine 5 game. To bring more structure to these releases, the team identified two different phases: a *pre-season* release phase and a *seasonal* release phase. 

Below are the four releases planned for the **pre-season** phase:
1. Showroom environment
2. Flight / Race, Multiplayer Instances
3. Crafting building materials, Ship cargo & hauling
4. ECOS attack, Looting & skins

The first pre-release (R1) was launched during the last 426Live event, and the next step will be the release of the R2 release that was demoed last week.

There will be 2 more pre-season releases coming next year, after which the team will flag that phase as completed, switching to a seasonal release schedule instead.
## The Warp Gate Project

Starting with R3, the Showroom map will be greatly expanded and the players will have to work together to create the very first **megastructure** project within Star Atlas. Everyone will work collaboratively to collect materials and resources from mining facilities and contribute these to the creation of a *warp gate*. Once completed, this gate will take players out of the Showroom into the wider Star Atlas universe!

![The warp gate project - Current showroom can be seen in the lower left corner](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/c9d9ae76dc5261d06cc8501ceb6a3d2e31f88f2f97bdaac3167c58afc48ba436.png)

## UE5: Seasons

## Season 0

After the gate has been completed, players will enter Season 0 and the pre-release cycle will have come to an end.

Season 0 will introduce a full game loop around combat racing. It will also mark a major milestone for Star Atlas, leading them to name this release *Star Atlas: Alive*.

**Season 0 - Combat Racing**
- Racing career
- Fighter career
- SAGE (Star Atlas: Golden Era, see below)

![Star Atlas: Alive - Season 0](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/c279b93869e3375871e00f0cf41277a353751123947ea0f456531488468ebc23.png)

## Season 1-8

Moving forward after the launch of Season 0, the team will release new content in a seasonal format going forward, until they've managed to complete their vision for Star Atlas v1. Every season will consist of some specialization of certain gameplay mechanics wherein they enhance one (or more) of the professions in the game.

Note that these seasons are going to take many years to roll out, with Michaels stating that they presently still expect to *need ****5 - 7 years**** to finish this roadmap*.

## UE5: Pipeline Footage

## SCREAM aka SA:GE

Besides some new screenshots of the current state of affairs, not much was shared on SCREAM at Breakpoint. However, the team did reveal the official name for Project SCREAM on stage on Monday. Henceforth SCREAM will be called **Star Atlas: Golden Era**. The team's [Medium article](https://medium.com/star-atlas/cosmic-alpha-burst-star-atlas-unveils-roadmap-graphic-novel-sage-and-more-at-solana-breakpoint-835589ba28e7) describes it as follows:
> [...] a top-down, webGL-based, grand strategy game with some of the same game loops that will take place in later seasons of Star Atlas

On stage, Michael added that one of the reasons for calling this *Golden Era* is because it unlocks the next generation of game economics across the Star Atlas ecosystem.

![SA:GE - Game Overview](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/22e0cf349564160728e7aeb70bc624f642eac17146a683a0a7d56719b8d3e104.png)

## Graphic Novel

Michael officially launched the Star Atlas Graphic Novel: CORE during his Breakpoint address. Over the course of 18 months, a new issue (chapter) will be released on every first Wednesday of the month, and it will be freely available across all of the major e-reader apps (e.g. Amazon, Apple, Barnes & Noble, etc).

The comic is set just before the Convergence War and tells the story of how a select group of individuals can change the entire course of history.
> It’s a tale of heroism, heartbreak, and epic adventure from a team of award-winning creatives that will be released later this year.

The first issue is now [available](https://play.staratlas.com/comic/core?episode=1&edition=standard) for everyone to read!

> Our brand-new Graphic Novel, #StarAtlasCORE, is officially out! ✨

> Now, we're excited to announce that a free version of Ep. 1 is available on @AppleBooks in over 50 countries across the world! 🌐

## NFT Collection

If you are a collector, or you'd like to get your hands on a physical book, then you can also choose to buy a commemorative NFT for $20 (in SOL).

There are two of these NFTs, one is being sold on the [Galactic Marketplace](https://play.staratlas.com/market/4Rrcj4MArUcMtHPp6amTy3SUXbCGYG3n8sf8KgMKjRnr), and the other is sold via [Magic Eden](https://magiceden.io/launchpad/star_atlas_episode_1). Both marketplaces offer a unique collectible cover!

If you own 18 consecutive exclusive covers (from either GM or ME), you will have the option to redeem them (possibly through burning) for a physical, hard-bound copy of the complete Graphic Novel.

There are also some other benefits to buying these limited edition NFTs: You will get early access to the monthly series and on top of that, you will get expanded content.

But there is more!
## Treasure Hunt

Readers can also hunt for clues in every issue, that collectively will unlock a mystery and a prize when the last issue has been released! However, these secret messages are only available to those who buy the exclusive covers.

Being one of the first explorers to crack the *Arc Cypher* may earn you:
1. The complete Digital Edition of CORE
2. A meeting with the writing team
3. A Ship skin based on the graphic novel
4. Extra exclusive content

## Faction Trivia Competition

The Community team is organizing a new competition for the community, called Faction Trivia. This event will span 3 rounds over three weeks, with the rounds taking place on November 11th, 18th, and 25th in the Star Atlas Discord voice chat.

During each of these rounds, questions will be asked, with points going to each faction that manages to answer a question correctly first.

At the end of the 3 weeks, the faction with the most points will win.
## Prizes

Each correctly answered question will yield the person answering one raffle ticket. The community members of the winning faction will see their raffle tickets double. The prizes that will be raffled out have not yet been announced.

One more special prize will go to the top scorer of the winning faction. They will get a special behind-the-scenes look at the Star Atlas [team's Discord] server.
