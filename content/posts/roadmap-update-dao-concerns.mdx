* Mobile Optimization  
  * Faction Selection implementation done
* Marketplace improvement proposal approved and ready for kickoff

* OpenSea migration to Solana ongoing. If you have any OpenSea posters, please open a ticket on Discord

Michael Wagner, Star Atlas CEO, gave us some more insights regarding the DAO concerns: “We are pivoting to a different tech solution. It’s still our number one priority for the year.” The team was still targeting February. “Still in final R&D on the alternative though, so can’t provide any guarantee, as always. Feb is my best estimate right now. We’re all hands on deck for the DAO.”
