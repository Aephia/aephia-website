_On July 18th, 2021, Prometheus & Funcracker opened the doors to one of the first Star Atlas guilds (aka DACs) in existence. Since then, [Aephia Industries](https://aephia.com)‘ vision resonated with well over 1700 Star Atlas enthusiasts. We are here today because of them, because of you. We owe our success to all of you!_

Congratulations Aephians! We’re two years into this roller-coaster of a journey, and things are starting to heat up on the Star Atlas side! We embraced the most promising metaverse game very early on, but if you’ve just heard about Star Atlas in 2023, you are still early. No one will downplay the many obstacles we’ve encountered along the way, but they have shaped us into what we are today. And our community today is stronger than ever before!

Aephia Anniversary PFP 2023

These last two years, we have been working hard to mold Aephia into the community we want it to be: Star Atlas focused, sharing knowledge with the wider community, an incubator for cool game-related concepts, and governed by the people.

At [COPA 2022](https://aephia.com/copa-2022-aephia-industries/), we lifted the veil on many of the things we had been working on, while also going a bit deeper into two of the awesome game-extending features that will form a core component of Aephia Industries in the metaverse:

* Membership Profiles
* (Co)mission Board

(these are both working titles)

Earlier this year, we published our first [State of Aephia](https://aephia.com/star-atlas/the-state-of-aephia/) document (internally), shining a little more light on the work done during the second half of 2022, and we look forward to giving a new update on Membership Profiles and our DAO setup at COPA 2023, later this year!

However, as it’s our anniversary today, we felt the need to share something cool this week instead of waiting any longer. To that end, we are happy to announce that one of our big **side projects** is about to come to life!

## ALF NFT Project

**_Our in-house NFT project, AEP Life Form (ALF in short), is beginning its launch sequence!_**

For the past 18 months, we have been working on a Solana NFT campaign that:

* has a ton of potential, allowing it to reach outside of the confines of Aephia, or even the wider Star Atlas community
* will bring Star Atlas to more people
* is appealing to people who are in the NFT space
* just absolutely rocks

We are now at a stage where we are comfortable sharing more with our members, and we will do so tomorrow! On July 19th, we’ll share the **_ALF Lite Paper_** in the member-only area of [our Discord server](https://discord.gg/aephia)! We’re looking forward to your reactions and feedback!

Follow our dedicated Twitter account, [@AEPLifeForm](https://twitter.com/AEPLifeForm), to stay up to speed from now on!

## Project Cataclysm

We would be remiss not to mention that one other, well-known side-project today: _Project Cataclysm_ (working title). We’ve been asked about its status a lot since the teaser trailer was dropped right before Christmas 2022\. Cataclysm is to be a 1-vs-1 card game set in one of the most famous locations in the Galia Expanse: the Cataclysm! _\[red: who would have guessed?\]_

We have been making steady progress on this project for well over a year, and we’re quite happy with how Cataclysm is shaping up! This being a passion project by the community, it does take a lot of time to build on the side. As such, we are not yet ready to reveal more details or glimpses today. Stay tuned to learn more at COPA 2023, though!

## COPA 2023

We are, of course, aware that most of our members are also quite eager to learn more about our upcoming Aephia DAO, Member(ship) Profiles, and our (Co-)Mission board (working title). As mentioned before, we are going to shine a spotlight on all of these during our COPA 2023 presentation. And we will definitely have more information to share than last year, so stay tuned!

_**COPA 2023 is going to be a blast!**_

## Anniversary Schedule

[Last year](https://aephia.com/star-atlas/aephia-turns-one/) we organized a full week of events to celebrate our 1-year milestone! We even got the team to organize a _426 Live_ event in the smack middle of the week! 😉 This year, we have again spread out our celebrations over multiple days, but we’re doing different things! And once again, the team happily stepped up to collaborate with us, in an even bigger fashion, during this festive week!

Below you will find our anniversary schedule for this year. It’s nothing like last year! We’re cutting it a little shorter, but only because we’re packing a ton of stuff into the next few days.
