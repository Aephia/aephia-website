Today we have some more tidbits from an [interview](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1193341456) with Star Atlas Chief Revenue Officer, Pablo Quiroga and CEO, Michael Wagner. Unfortunately, the first half of the interview was in Spanish, so we couldn’t get much information there. However, we still got some new information from Michael.

First off, the mini-game is most likely expected to get comparable graphics to the desktop version. Developers are working on two possibilities. However, the most likely of the two is to have the graphics rendered on the servers and then streamed to mobile devices. Similar to how [Google Stadia](https://stadia.google.com/) works. If the developers move forward with this option, this would improve the experience by exponentially for mobile users.

Next up, Michael also mentioned that the ROI on ships, is expected to be over 100% per ship per year net (after expenses). At least, in the initial period of the mini-game. However, this might still change or it can be adjusted if needed.

Unfortunately, we still do not have a confirmation on the release date of the mini-game. So, it could still be delayed further from the current release date on 18th November. Keep an eye on the official [roadmap page](https://staratlas.notion.site/staratlas/72cb710bbd894cd8819bde948e42ac31?v=5c5cca97579e4cd79089362bf03e55b1) for the latest updates. It was confirmed though, that frontend development was completed and there’s only the frontend integration and on-chain features remaining.
