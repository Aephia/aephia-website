Answering a question on whether there will be a limit to the number of ships that can be deployed in [SCORE](https://staratlas.notion.site/SCORE-Ship-Missions-TIER-0-49b551ed074141f19af926c5193ea4c1) (early mini-game) missions, Michael Wagner (Star Atlas CEO), confirmed that “_Each ship type will be enlisted separately, and there is no limit to the quantity you can supply_“. The way we understand it, is that you can deploy any number of ships, but as at time of writing, the plans are that you can only deploy ships individually. Not as a fleet.
