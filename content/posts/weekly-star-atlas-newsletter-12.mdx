## News

The [Star Atlas Official Roadmap](https://staratlas.notion.site/staratlas/72cb710bbd894cd8819bde948e42ac31?v=313101ae608947c9856abad44577194b) has been updated with the latest information on upcoming modules and features. As with all roadmaps and as previously stated in our previous issues, the information and dates in this roadmap are subject to change. In this case the team actually removed all of the target dates, but they assured us these will be added back once their planning is done! Be sure to bookmark this page to stay up to date. 

Next, the team published an article on Faction Aligned Companies, which we’ll see a little of in CREAM v0, but a lot more later down the line with the release of SCORE v1 and CREAM v1. Read [Faction Aligned Companies (Public)](https://staratlas.notion.site/Faction-Aligned-Companies-Public-003dffe8c5c64fe88cce59793dd6ceb5) and [Star Atlas Feature Reveal: Faction Aligned Companies](https://medium.com/star-atlas/star-atlas-faction-aligned-companies-f7b56f2bd348) for complete details.

Additionally, we used this information to publish our first guide: [Shipbuilding: Blueprints & Loyalty](https://aephia.com/star-atlas/star-atlas-shipbuilding-blueprints-loyalty).

Lastly, the very first town hall for this year took place last Friday, January 14 where they further elaborated on the subjects mentioned above. For details on topics covered during the town hall, visit the [news section](https://aephia.com/star-atlas-news/) on our official website.

## Assets

The first GAO phase saw the release of 24 ships. Originally these were planned to happen over a 3-month timespan, but due to delays with SCORE it took the team a little longer. For 2022 the team announced it is planning to sell a total of 25 ships only, meaning they are slowing the release down a notch.. Previously the team mentioned there are at least 120 ships already planned to be released to the public.

Despite being mentioned in the brochure for GAO phase 1, the team chose not to sell the titan ships last year. However, they now stated these sales will happen during 2022. The plan is still to sell these titan ships via an auction process, and the team is thinking to use a reverse Dutch auction setup

The team figured out their VWAP numbers for 3 ships were different from ours, so they corrected them. This has led to a change in SCORE earnings for the following ships: Pearce X4, Opal Jet, and Ogrika Thripid. The correct VWAP values for these ships are for the Pearce X4: $22.66, the Opal Jet: $20 and finally the Ogrika Thripid: $8506.43.

## CREAM

Last year the roadmap mentioned MORE as the module to expect mid March 2022, but the roadmap makes no more mention of it. Instead a new module that supersedes MORE can be found listed: CREAM.

Primary difference between the two is that CREAM will also add a limited form of crafting. The first version V0 should allow players to construct a few small spacecraft, before allowing a wider array of these with the release of V1 at the end of the year.

## DAO

Though the roadmap no longer shows target dates (at the moment), during the Townhall Michael mentioned that the long-awaited Star Atlas DAO is targeted to be launched at some point in February.

## Marketplace

The team announced that they are developing a brand new marketplace to replace the current Serum-based one.The goal is to better embed it within the “game” and to remove the need for claiming/settling trades.
