SAGE Starbased is live! There are no two ways about it: the biggest news this past week was, without a doubt, the mainnet launch of _SAGE_ _Starbased_. But that does not mean nothing else happened. We got a second Surge test this past Saturday, an announcement date for the next UE5 multiplayer stress test, and a brand new ship sale, the Calico Shipit!

_Let’s dive straight in!_

![SAGE Starbased - Play Now!](https://assets.aephia.com/wp-assets/45adeeaa0dd21d52c95f6eaad068b57cd5e8085baa9daeb2431dea89877bbc2b.png)

SAGE Starbased – Play Now!

## Starbased Launched

After a delay of more than a day, the team managed to [launch SAGE Starbased](https://medium.com/star-atlas/announcing-starbased-a-new-chapter-in-the-star-atlas-sage-saga-5dc3b9abe44d) on Solana’s mainnet. The insane congestion going on was giving the team a rough time, as they rely on many sequences of transactions to set up the game, and if one of these fails, they have to start over the whole sequence. Besides this, the sheer number of transactions required to get the game’s on-chain programs published on Solana has already made this a tough process. The team needed over 5000 transactions for this alone.

On **April 4th**, around **06:00 UTC**, the team was finally able to open the doors to the latest installment of SAGE Labs!

To give the players a fair chance to get their assets in, ATLAS earnings were turned off during the first epoch. This means that LP earned those first 18 hours could only be sold for ATLAS the next epoch.

Due to the congestion of the Solana network, which was not being helped by the launch of several new token claims, airdrops, and meme tokens, people experienced a lot of trouble pulling their assets out of Faction Fleet and the old SAGE Labs game. And, of course, they experienced issues getting these into Starbased next as well, though that seemed to go a little smoother.

After the launch, the team worked on bringing some of their improvements for Starbased in this regard over to the Play portal as well. This did help to some extent.

There were a few bugs it would see during the first two epochs, most prominently one where the XP ceiling was not in place, allowing players to rake up hundreds of thousands of XP. The team fixed this for epoch #2 and is currently working on correcting the XP count for those who inadvertently profited from this glitch.

Meanwhile, a few days later, Starbased gameplay seems to slowly blossom as players find their footing. The _faction-balancing_ aspect of the ATLAS earnings does throw some people off, and it will be interesting to see this evolve over time.

**We released an [extensive guide](https://aephia.com/star-atlas/starbased-the-missing-manual/)** for existing SAGE Labs players to get you up to speed quickly. It primarily covers the big changes: _Starbase Upgrades_ & _Upkeep_, _Loyalty Points_, _Experience Points_, and _ATLAS Earnings_. If you are interested in the amount of resources needed for _Starbase upgrades_ & _upkeep_, or how much _LP_ & _XP_ your activities are worth, the [guide](https://aephia.com/star-atlas/starbased-the-missing-manual/) includes tables for all of these!

For those who want to learn more about the new _ATLAS emissions_ mechanic and its implications, including _Faction Balancing_, we recommend checking out our [long-form article](https://aephia.com/star-atlas/a-new-economic-paradigm/) introducing this mechanic (with an example).

## Calico Shipit

A day before the originally planned launch date of Starbased, the team launched a new small transporter ship. The timing of this was likely not a coincidence, as many SAGE Labs players were struggling to get their resources out of the old game.

The Calico Shipit is a _small_ ship with a _freighter_ role. It is the smallest freighter that has been released so far. You can currently buy it for [645 USDC](https://play.staratlas.com/market/SHiPitEZcCoyXEKqw9ovCdYeNzck9uVbb1KCcsHaGhc/) (or [86,000 ATLAS](https://play.staratlas.com/market/SHiPitEZcCoyXEKqw9ovCdYeNzck9uVbb1KCcsHaGhc/)) on the Galactic Marketplace. 

The team set the origination price at 860 USDC, but this first tranche (3500 ships, split 50/50 over both markets) is enjoying a 25% discount. So far, the team has minted 11,628 Calico Shipits, but they have not officially shared the number of Shipits they plan to sell over time.

As with all newly released ships, there is a 90-day window during which secondary sales are not possible on the official marketplace.

## Surge & Stresstest

A little over a week ago, the team [hosted](https://aephia.com/star-atlas/weekly-star-atlas-newsletter-123/) their first small-scale Surge game mode test in UE5\. That time, the game was hard to play due to lag and stuttering. During the last week, however, the developers fixed most of these game-crippling bugs, leading to a second Surge test this past Saturday.

Overall, it looks like most players had a great time, and the lag was gone for most of them. All in all it was a very enjoyable experience already, though of course there were still some bugs that got in the way at times. Fortunately, the team was already of most of these, and they will continue squashing bugs until the big event on April 20th.

### Multiplayer Stresstest April 20

The team announced the next massive multiplayer _public_ stress test will take place on Saturday, April 20th. Like last time, the goal is to get as many people in the game as possible. The team hopes to see close to 2000 players participating in this test.

Because there was not much to do during the first test, the team spent the past three months developing the Surge game mode. This mode will be front and center during this second public stress test, giving participants an enjoyable game during the test window.

As the team already announced during the [previous Town Hall](https://aephia.com/star-atlas/town-hall-report-february-27-2024/), this second stress test will come with rewards as well! The team will track player participation and reward it with ATLAS and Crew Cards. The exact amount will depend on the milestone achieved. The last[ we’ve heard](https://aephia.com/star-atlas/weekly-star-atlas-newsletter-119/) is that the reward tiers look like this:

* 0-500 concurrent players: Tier 1 rewards
* 500-1000 concurrent players: Tier 2 rewards
* 1000+ concurrent players: Tier 3 rewards

## Small News Bits

Some smaller news items to round up the past week:

* Solana congestion has caused plenty of issues this past week, but the team found the time to roll out some of their Starbased mitigations to the other SAGE Labs interfaces, the Marketplace, and the Play-portal as well.
* As announced previously, the Faction Fleet earnings have been cut by 50%. In addition, the Miner ships no longer produce R4 in Faction Claims. There was a bug preventing people from withdrawing their Mining ships from Faction Claims, but the team has fixed this.

## Ship Pics

There are no sneak peeks this week, but we felt compelled to share some more pictures of the Calico Shipit with you.
